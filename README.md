# 📖 Family Cookbook (Eleventy / 11ty)

![CI](https://github.com/peralese/cookbook/actions/workflows/ci-build.yml/badge.svg) ![Deploy](https://github.com/peralese/cookbook/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

A static, mobile-friendly family cookbook built with **Eleventy**.  
Recipes are stored as JSON in `content/<Category>/…` and rendered into clean pages with **pagination, categories, tags, breadcrumbs, print styles**, **client-side search**, and **GitHub Pages** hosting under `/cookbook/`.

The current design uses a green-and-cream family cookbook theme with a branded header, illustrated hero artwork, category cards on the home page, recipe detail sidebars, and print-friendly recipe pages.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- **Stable URLs** for every recipe: `/recipes/<category>/<title>/`
- **Collections-based build** (single source of truth from `content/`)
- **Robust image resolver** (finds images next to JSON, in `images/`, etc.; handles case/extension differences)
- **Path-prefix safe** links & assets (works at `/cookbook/` on GitHub Pages)
- **Print stylesheet** for nice hard copies
- **“Print Recipe” button** on detail pages with header (title / yield / source) in print view
- **Clean dev workflow** with or without a path prefix
- **Yield** and **Source** rendered as full sections (like Ingredients / Directions / Remarks)
- **Client-side search** using Fuse.js with fuzzy matching
- **Header search form** that passes queries through to `/search/?q=...`
- **Illustrated cookbook hero** using extracted PNG assets from `src/images/`
- **Home page category cards** and recently added recipe rows
- **Two-column recipe detail layout** with recipe info, category, and tag sidebar cards
- **Footer “Search” link** for quick access
- **JSON Schema validation** on every recipe at build time (Ajv 2020-12)

## 🧠 Data Model (normalized)

The loader in `.eleventy.js` reads each `content/<Category>/*.json`, normalizes fields, and produces a collection item with:

- `title` — from `title | Title | name | recipeTitle | meta.title | filename`
- `category` — from folder name or JSON; used for grouping
- `filename` — JSON filename without extension
- `slugCategory`, `slugTitle`, `slugTitleUnique`, `slugTitleFlat`
- `urlPath` — canonical path `/recipes/<slugCategory>/<slugTitleUnique>/`
- `ingredients` — from `ingredients|Ingredients|…`
- `directions` — from `directions|Directions|instructions|Instructions`
- `remarks` — from `remarks|Remarks|notes|…` (with `Yield:` / `Source:` stripped if embedded)
- `yield` — from `yield|Yield|servings|…` or extracted from remarks
- `source` — from `source|Source|attribution|…` or extracted from remarks
- `imageUrl` — resolved to a public URL by scanning likely locations
- `tags` — normalized to a simple string array

> The build **fails** if a recipe doesn’t conform to the schema (see “Schema Validation” below).

---

## 🌐 URL Structure

- **All Recipes (paginated):** `/recipes/page/1/`, `/recipes/page/2/`, …
- **Recipe detail:** `/recipes/<category-slug>/<title-slug>/`
- **Categories index:** `/categories/`
- **Per category:** `/category/<category-slug>/`
- **Tags index:** `/tags/`
- **Per tag:** `/tags/<tag-slug>/`
- **Search:** `/search/` (powered by Fuse.js)

---

## 🔍 Search

- `/search-index.json` built at compile time with all recipes (title, tags, category, URL)
- `/search/` page uses Fuse.js for fuzzy matching
- Header search submits to `/search/?q=<query>` and pre-populates the search page
- Debounced input for instant results
- Displays matched recipe title, category, tags, and optional match score

---

## 🎨 Theme & Assets

The site theme is implemented primarily in `src/styles.css` and shared through `src/layouts/base.njk`.

- Header and footer use a dark green branded treatment.
- The hero uses two transparent PNG illustrations:
  - `src/images/cookbook-hero-left.png`
  - `src/images/cookbook-hero-right.png`
- Eleventy copies `src/images/**` to `/images/**` during build.
- The home page renders category cards and recent recipe rows from collections.
- Recipe detail pages use a two-column layout with the recipe content on the left and metadata/category/tag cards on the right.

When previewing locally, use `npm run serve` so links resolve from `/`. For GitHub Pages output under `/cookbook/`, use `npm run build`.

---

## ✅ Schema Validation (JSON Schema 2020-12)

We validate each recipe JSON against `src/_data/recipe.schema.json` during the Eleventy build using **Ajv**.

- Draft: **2020-12** (`$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"`)
- Runtime: **Ajv 8 (2020 build)** + **ajv-formats**

If validation fails, Eleventy logs which file failed and why, and the build stops.

### Install (dev dependencies)

```bash
npm i -D ajv@^8 ajv-formats@^2
```

### Implementation (in `.eleventy.js`)

```js
const Ajv = require("ajv/dist/2020");
const addFormats = require("ajv-formats");
const recipeSchema = require("./src/_data/recipe.schema.json");

const ajv = new Ajv({ allErrors: true, strict: false });
addFormats(ajv);
const validateRecipe = ajv.compile(recipeSchema);

// ...when loading each recipe object:
const ok = validateRecipe(data);
if (!ok) {
  const details = validateRecipe.errors.map(e => `• ${e.instancePath || "(root)"} ${e.message}`).join("\n");
  throw new Error(`Recipe schema validation failed for ${where}\n${details}`);
}
```

---

## 🧪 Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies from the lockfile
npm ci

# Serve without prefix (browse at http://localhost:8080/)
npm run serve

# Or serve with explicit prefix (browse at http://localhost:8080/cookbook/)
PATH_PREFIX=/cookbook/ npm run serve
```

> The dev server respects `PATH_PREFIX` at runtime so you can test GitHub Pages behavior locally.

---

## 🏗️ Build & Deploy (GitHub Pages)

```bash
npm run build
```

- Output goes to `dist/`.
- Default `pathPrefix` is `/cookbook/`; override by setting `PATH_PREFIX` (e.g., `/` for root).

**GitHub Pages tip:** If publishing from `dist/` via Actions, make sure your action copies `./dist` to the Pages artifact and **does not** strip the subfolder structure.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Environment variable(s):

- `PATH_PREFIX` — overrides the site prefix. Examples:
  - `PATH_PREFIX=/` → site at domain root
  - `PATH_PREFIX=/cookbook/` → site under `/cookbook/` (default behavior in code)

The config auto-detects and passthrough-copies the following if they exist:
- `src/style.css` → `/style.css`
- `src/styles.css` → `/style.css`
- `src/print.css` → `/print.css`
- `src/images/**` → `/images/**`
- `src/assets/js/fuse-search.js` → `/assets/js/fuse-search.js`
- `content/**` (or `src/content/**`) → `/content/**`

---

## ➕ Adding a Recipe

1. Create or choose a category folder under `content/`, e.g. `content/01 - Breakfast/`.
2. Add a JSON file with required fields (**Title**, **Ingredients**, **Instructions**) and optional fields (**Image**, **Tags**, **Remarks**, **Yield**, **Source**).
3. Place the image next to the JSON or in `src/images/`.
4. Run the dev server; schema validation will catch any issues.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap (next steps)

**Near-term**  
- 🔒 Finalize `recipe.schema.json` field definitions (tighten types, require non-empty arrays for `ingredients`/`directions`).  
- 🧪 Add a lightweight CI task (GitHub Actions) that runs `npm ci && npm run build` to validate schema and links.  
- 🔍 Enhance search UX (highlighted matches, keyboard navigation, “no results” state).  
- 🖼️ Image improvements: responsive `<img srcset>` and basic lazy-loading.  
- 🧰 **Enhance existing “Add Recipe” helper** (CLI and Flask form in `recipe_editor.py`) with schema-based field validation, inline feedback, and optional tag suggestions.

**Medium-term**  
- 🗂️ Category & tag housekeeping: optional lints to normalize capitalization and dedupe tags.  
- ♿ Accessibility audit (focus order, contrast, skip links, landmarks).  
- 🌐 i18n scaffolding (labels and headings via data files).  
- 🗺️ Sitemap & RSS/JSON feed for recipe updates.  

**Nice-to-have**  
- 🧮 Nutrition/notes optional sections with schema support.  
- 🧷 Per-recipe assets folder convention (e.g., `content/<Cat>/<Recipe>/images/*`).  
- 🧰 Dev script to migrate old JSON formats to the normalized schema automatically.

### Import and review a recipe locally

Run the local editor (this is separate from the static GitHub Pages website):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python recipe_editor.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000. Choose a category, upload a recipe photo or
`.docx` / UTF-8 `.txt` document, or paste text. Images support PNG, JPEG,
TIFF, BMP, and WebP, with a 12 MB upload limit. Install the **Tesseract OCR**
command on your computer for image extraction (on Ubuntu: `sudo apt install
 tesseract-ocr`). Older `.doc` files must first be saved as `.docx`.

Extraction runs locally. Headings such as Ingredients, Instructions, Directions,
Method, Notes, Yield, and Source are recognized. Without headings, quantities, short ingredient names, and cooking verbs help
suggest ingredient and instruction sections. Wrapped instruction lines are joined.
Unclassified text remains in Notes; suggestions still need review, especially for
handwriting, multiple columns, or multiple recipes on one page. Check quantities and temperatures carefully. The extracted text
stays visible during review, and you can edit every section, add family memories,
source information, equipment, and comma-separated tags before saving.

Importing does **not** write a recipe. Only **Save reviewed recipe** writes JSON
under `content/<Category>/`; existing filenames cannot be overwritten by a new
recipe. Existing recipes can also be opened and edited. Saving is local: run
`npm run build` and use the normal repository deployment to publish. Keep this
editor bound to localhost; it is not a hosted multi-user submission service.

After a successful save, the editor removes the imported source from `inputs/`
when its filename and contents exactly match the uploaded file. Other input files
are retained. Failed imports, validation errors, and filename conflicts do not
remove the source. If the source changes during review, it is retained; a cleanup
failure is reported after saving. Files uploaded from outside `inputs/` are not
deleted. Restart the editor and re-import to enable cleanup for a review started
before this feature was installed.
