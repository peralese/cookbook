  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 slice of bacon, cut into ½-inch pieces",
    "1 medium size onion, sliced thin",
    "2 pounds boiling potatoes, peeled and cut into ½-inch slices",
    "1 teaspoons salt",
    "¼ teaspoon pepper",
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1 cup chicken stock",
    "Instruction:",
    "In a skillet cook the bacon over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is almost crisp.  (The bacon will stop cooking as soon as you add the onion so don’t rush cooking the bacon.)  Add the onion and continue cooking the mixture, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the onion is softened and translucent.  Add the potatoes, 1 cup of chicken stock, the salt, the pepper, and the butter and bring the liquid to a boil.  Cook the potatoes over moderate heat, shaking the skillet occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.  Remove the skillet from the heat and let the potatoes stand, covered, for a final 10 minutes."
