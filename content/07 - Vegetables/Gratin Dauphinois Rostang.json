  "title": "Gratin Dauphinois Rostang (Scalloped Potatoes)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 pounds potatoes",
    "3 cups milk",
    "2 cups whipping cream",
    "1 stick (½ cup) cold butter",
    "2½ teaspoons salt",
    "pepper to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Peel the potatoes and rinse them under running cold water.  Slice the potatoes into ⅛-inch rounds and spread them in a well buttered gratin dish just large enough to hold them in a ½ to ¾ inch overall layer.  Sprinkle the potatoes with the salt and pepper and add the three cups of milk, or enough to just cover the layer of potatoes.  Bring the milk to a boil on top of the stove and add one cup of the heavy cream.  Stir the mixture carefully to combine the liquids but not disturbing the layer of potatoes.  Slice 1 stick of cold butter over the potatoes and bake them in a preheated, moderately hot oven (350° F.), adding the final cup of heavy cream periodically, ¼ cup at a time every 30 minutes, for two hours.  After the addition of the last of the cream bake the potatoes for 30 more minutes, or until the liquid within the potatoes is reduced and the potatoes are a deep golden brown.",
    "Remarks:  I received rave comments on this dish when I made it one year for the Christmas Party at work.  Everyone wanted to know what kind of “cheese” I had used in making this dish; they were incredulous when I said there was no “cheese” in the recipe.",
    "Yield:  Serves 4 to 6 persons.",
