    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 red onion finely diced",
    "3 large russet potatoes",
    "1 tablespoon kosher salt",
    "2 packages Boursin cheese (5.2 ounces each)",

  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350° F",
    "Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a skillet over medium low heat.  When the oil is hot add the onion and sauté for 4 minutes, or until softened and just beginning to color.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  Rub the potatoes with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and the salt and arrange in a roasting pan.  Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the potatoes can be pierced easily with a fork.",
    "Remove the potatoes from the oven and cut in half lengthwise.  Carefully scoop as much of the potato flesh as you can without breaking the skin.  Place the potato flesh in a bowl and add the sautéed red onion, Boursin, sour cream, chives, mustard and egg.  Mix until thoroughly incorporated and season with salt and pepper.  Stuff the potato skins with the  mixture and return to the roasting pan.  Bake for 15 minutes or until the tops are golden brown.  Serve immediately."
