    "In a large kettle, or pot, cover the potatoes with 2 inches of salted cold water and bring it to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer the potatoes for 40 to 50 minutes, or until they are tender and easily pierced with a toothpick.  Drain the potatoes, let them cool until you can handle them and then peel them.  Mash them with a potato masher.  Stir in the softened butter and enough of the milk to reach the consistency that you prefer.  As a final step add salt, pepper, and the green onions.  Stir, taste to ensure the level of salt and pepper is to your desires and serve hot."
