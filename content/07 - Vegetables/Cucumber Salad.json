    "cucumbers; approximately 5 lbs total",

    "¼ cup distilled white vinegar",

  "instructions": [
    "In a large colander, toss the seedless cucumbers, sliced very thin with 2 teaspoons salt, and let them drain for 45 minutes, after which pat them dry.",
    "In a small bowl combine ¼ cup distilled white vinegar, 4 teaspoons sugar, 2 garlic cloves, minces, and pepper (to taste) and let the dressing stand for 45 minutes.",
    "Strain the dressing into a serving bowl, add the cucumber and the large red onion, sliced thinly, and toss the salad well.  Sprinkle the salad with 1 tablespoon sweet Hungarian paprika.",
    "Remarks:  If your worried about the strength of the onion then slice the onion thinly and soak it in salted water for 45 minutes (the same amount of time that you let the cucumbers drain and the dressing stand before using.)   Additionally, you may make a smaller quantity by cutting down on the number of cucumbers you use.  However, keep the amount of vinegar the same and use only one clove of garlic, instead of two.",
