  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 375º F.",
    "Start with 10 ounces (by weight) of pure butter puff pastry dough; this tart is characterized by its buttery, oily flakiness.  Roll it (the dough) out and stamp it into eight 4-inch circles, then place them on a greased baking sheet, and refrigerate until you need them.",
    "Tear the prosciutto roughly and put it in a food processor with half of the olive oil, the garlic cloves, and pepper.  Blend on the “Purée Setting” for a few seconds until you have a rough purée.  Slice the tomatoes, or halve if they are cherry ones.  Tear the basil leaves and add them to the remaining olive oil, but not more than 20 minutes before you are going to use them or they will bruise and blacken.",
    "Spoon a mound of the prosciutto mixture on to each tart bottom, leaving a clear edge of about ¼ inch.  Place a circle of tomatoes on top, brush with oil, sprinkle with coarsely chopped thyme or rosemary, and cook for about 15 minutes, until the dough is puffed up and cooked through.  Put the tarts on a rack and brush with the basil and oil mixture, then serve them warm.",
