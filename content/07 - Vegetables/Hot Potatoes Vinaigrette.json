  "title": "Hot Potatoes Vinaigrette",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 tablespoons wine vinegar, white or red, the selection is optional",
    "1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard",
    "⅔ cup olive oil",
    "2 pounds new potatoes, peeled",
    "2 shallots, minced, or a small yellow onion if you prefer",
    "Minced fresh parsley leaves, or chopped chives if you prefer"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a bowl combine the vinegar, the mustard, add salt and pepper to your taste, then add the oil in a stream, whisking as you pour it in.  Whisk the dressing until it is well emulsified.  Set the dressing aside.",
    "In a saucepan cover the potatoes with 2 inches of cold salted water and bring the water to a boil, over high heat.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the potatoes, covered, for 20 minutes, or until they are tender.  Test them with a knife or a toothpick.  Once they are tender drain the potatoes and transfer them to the serving bowl.  Immediately add the shallots, parsley, and dressing and toss the mixture well.  Serve immediately, serve hot."
  ],
  "remarks": "The shallots have a very mild onion taste and go well with the hot potatoes.  An alternative would be to use a sweet yellow onion instead, if you prefer a more robust onion flavor.  (Again, you may choose to cut the onion flavor by soaking the sliced onion in salted water for at least an hour before you use it.)  Or, to completely change the character of the dish you may wish to sauté the onions before adding them.",
