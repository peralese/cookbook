  "title": "Cilantro Rice (Arroz con Cilantro)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "½ medium white onion, cut into chunks",
    "1 bell pepper, cut into chunks",
    "1 chile poblano; or 2 chiles jalapeños, roasted, peeled and seeded",
    "5 garlic cloves",
    "1 cup cilantro leaves, chopped up into small bits",
    "4 cups chicken stock or water",
    "1 tablespoon butter",
    "2 cups white rice",
    "Salt and pepper to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Put the onion, bell pepper, chile, garlic, cilantro, and 1 cup of chicken stock (or water) into a blender.  Blend for 2 minutes.  Put the liquid plus the remaining 3 cups of stock and the butter in a 4-quart heavy stockpot and bring to a boil.  When the mixture is boiling add the rice and stir well and season with salt and pepper.  Let the mixture return to a boil, then lower the heat to low and cover the pot tightly.  Simmer the mixture for 15 to 20 minutes or until the liquid is totally absorbed.",
    "Remarks:  Make sure you add enough salt after the rice is added to the stock.  The rice absorbs the salt flavor while cooking, once the rice is cooked you can’t add anymore salt – it won’t be absorbed.  And remember the years-old adage, “Don’t peek at the rice!”",
    "Yield:  Serves 8.",
