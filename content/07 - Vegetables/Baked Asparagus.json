  "title": "Baked Asparagus",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 bunches asparagus",
    "1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "Coarse-grained salt",
    "Cracked black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 400° F.",
    "Place the asparagus in a large plastic bag.  Drizzle half of the olive oil over the asparagus, seal the bag, and shake until the asparagus is coated evenly with the olive oil.  (Depending on the size of the asparagus, 1 tablespoon may not be enough – add more if this seems to be the case.)  Place the asparagus in a single layer on a cookie sheet; season with salt and pepper.",
    "Bake the asparagus for 12 minutes for “crunchy” or up to 20 minutes, depending on your personal preferences."
  ],
  "remarks": "Don’t forget to snap off the woody bottoms of each stalk.  Don’t worry, “Mother Nature” saw to it that the asparagus breaks in just the right spot.  You save the ends for making stock.",
  "yield": "Serves 4.",
