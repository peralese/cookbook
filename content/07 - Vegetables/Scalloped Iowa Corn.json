  "instructions": [
    "Slice enough corn for the cobs to yield 2 cups, scraping the cobs against the edge of the container to remove the corn milk for the cobs.  Combine the corn, milk and sugar in a sauce pan.  Bring the mixture almost to a boil over medium heat; reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring often.  Drain the corn and save the liquid.",
    "Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat; add the flour, stirring until smooth.  Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Gradually add the saved corn liquid and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thickened and bubbly.  Remove from the heat and stir in the corn, salt, paprika, pepper, egg, and onion then set aside.",
    "Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a small skillet then remove it from the heat.  Stir in the cracker crumbs into the butter.  Stir in ½ cup of the crumb mixture into the corn mixture then spoon it into a deep, greased 1½-quart casserole dish.  Sprinkle the remaining crumb mixture over the top and bake, uncovered, in a preheated oven (350° F) for 20 to 25 minutes, or until lightly browned."
