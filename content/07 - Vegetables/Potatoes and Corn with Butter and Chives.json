  "title": "Potatoes and Corn with Butter and Chives",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1¼ pounds small potatoes, scrubber but not peeled",
    "2 cups fresh corn kernels (about 4 ears)",
    "2 tablespoons, chopped chives or sliced scallions",
    "1 tablespoon butter",
    "Coarse-grained salt and cracked black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water.  Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat to simmer, and cook the potatoes until fork-tender, about 18 to 20 minutes.",
    "While the potatoes are cooking place the corn in a microwave-proof dish with 1 tablespoon of water.  Cook the corn, covered, on high until just done, about 3 minutes.",
    "Drain the potatoes and place them back into the pot.  Add the corn, chives, butter, salt and pepper to taste.  Smash the potatoes with a potato masher or fork until they are coarse and very chunky.   Serve immediately."
  ],
  "remarks": "For my taste I would peel the potatoes. Choose the sweetest corn you can.  However, you can add some sugar, “a pinch” to the corn if need be. Yield:  Serves 4. Source:  Cooking Thin with Chef Kathleen, by Kathleen Daelemans, Houghton Mifflin Co., , © 2002 by Kathleen Daelemans.",
