    "Remarks:  The measures of ingredients for this recipe can easily be halved.  The recipe is copied from a Thanksgiving menu; intended for entertaining a group of persons.  The actual recipe calls for distilled white vinegar.  However, I prefer the milder sweet aftertaste of the balsamic vinegar with the green beans.",
