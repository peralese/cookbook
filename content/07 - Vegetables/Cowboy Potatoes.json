  "title": "Cowboy Potatoes",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 to 5 pounds small red potatoes, scrubbed and cut into wedges",
    "1 stick butter, melted",
    "1 medium white onion, sliced",
    "1 to 2 cloves garlic, minced",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "1 teaspoon ground black pepper",
    "½ teaspoon ground dried oregano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350º F.",
    "Coat the potato wedges with the melted butter and toss them with the onion and garlic.  Sprinkle them generously with salt, pepper, and oregano and place them in a baking dish that will hold everything.  Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the oven for 1 hour, opening the oven occasionally to give the baking dish a, “good shake”.  After 1 hour, remove the foil and continue cooking for another 30 minutes to give the potatoes a nice “color”."

  "remarks": "This is probably our [Perini Ranch Steakhouse] most popular side dish … because steak and potatoes are just standard for this part of the world.  This [dish] is easy because you don’t have to peel the potatoes, and the skin adds to the flavor and the color. Yield:  Serves 8 to 10.
