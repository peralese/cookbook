Bring to a boil; cook and stir 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from heat; stir in cheese until melted and then add the potatoes. If you want your potatoes to have a uniform design. Add one fanned layer of potatoes to the bottom of the dish, cover with sauce, add another layer, and more sauce. Continue this process and finish with a layer of sauce, making sure all potatoes are covered evenly. Transfer to an Emile Henry Au Gratin Oval baking dish. Cover and bake 1 hour. Uncover; bake 30-40 minutes or until the potatoes are tender and have some color."
