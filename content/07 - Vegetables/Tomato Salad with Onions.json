  "title": "Tomato Salad with Onions (Tamatem bell Bassal)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound firm vine ripe tomatoes, sliced",
    "1 large red onion; or, a large sweet yellow onion",
    "5 green onions (scallions), chopped",
    "2 tablespoon chopped cilantro; or, parsley",
    "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1 tablespoon wine vinegar; or, the juice of ½ lemon",
    "Salt and pepper",
    "½ teaspoon ground cumin (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Wash and slice the tomatoes.  Place the sliced tomato in a bowl with the onions and cilantro (or the parsley).",
    "Dress the salad with a mixture of oil and vinegar or the lemon juice.  Add salt and pepper, to taste, and toss.  Sprinkle with the cumin (if using) and serve.",
    "Remarks:  In my opinion, I would allow the sliced tomatoes to cool in the refrigerator for at least a half hour before dressing them with the oil and vinegar mixture.  I just think the salad would be better if the tomatoes were chilled.",
