  "title": "Marinated Red Onion Condiment (Cebolla Curtida)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 large red onion, at least 4 inches in diameter",
    "½ cup white vinegar",
    "½ teaspoon salt",
    "1 habanero chile; or, you may use a chile serrano"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Cut the onion lengthwise in half; then slice it across the grain into thick ¼-inch slices.  Put the slices in a strainer and wash all the slices 2 or 3 times with cold water, to ensure mildness.  Using paper towels pat all the onion slices completely dry.",
    "Place the onion slice in a glass bowl and pour the vinegar and salt over the onion slices.  Mix everything gently.",
    "Toast the habanero chile (or Serrano chili) on a comal and put it in the middle of the bowl – the habanero is not for eating but to spread its flavor and spiciness to the onions and to add a little color decoration to the dish.",
    "Remarks:  Cebolla curtida can be served as a relish with just about anything grilled; or with baked meats, tacos, and tortas.",
    "Yield:  Makes about 2 cups.",
