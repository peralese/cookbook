  "title": "Pilaf with Currants and Pine Nuts",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 large onion, chopped",
    "3 tablespoons of sunflower oil",
    "⅔ cup pine nuts, toasted",
    "2 cups long-grain rice",
    "3 cups chicken stock (or if you prefer, you may use 2 bouillon cubes)",
    "1 teaspoon ground allspice",
    "1 teaspoon cinnamon",
    "Salt and pepper, to taste",
    "3 tablespoons currants",
    "6 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large pan and over medium-high heat, fry the onion in the oil until it is soft and golden.  Add the toasted pine nuts and stir until well mixed.  Add the rice and stir until the rice is well coated with the oil.",
    "Add the chicken stock and stir in the allspice, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and the currants.  Bring the liquid to a boil, then lower the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes or all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender.",
    "Lastly, stir in the butter and serve hot."
  ],
  "remarks": "This is a classic dish from the courtly kitchens of Constantinople; with origins in the Ottoman Empire.  It goes well with meat or chicken dishes. Remember that with rice the salt is added to the liquid the rice will absorb, so taste the liquid to insure the “saltiness” is to your liking.  One should never add salt to the rice after all the liquid has been absorbed and is fully cooked. Yield:  Serves 6.
