  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 pounds of potatoes",
    "3 cups milk",
    "2 cups whipping cream",
    "1 stick (½  cup) cold butter",
    "2½ teaspoons salt",

  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Peel two pounds of potatoes and rinse them under running cold water.  Slice the potatoes into ⅛-inch rounds and spread them in a well buttered gratin dish just large enough to hold them in a ½ to ¾ inch layer.  Sprinkle the potatoes with the salt and pepper and add the three cups of milk, or enough to just cover the layers of potatoes.  Bring the milk to a boil on top of the stove and add 1 cup of heavy cream.  Stir the mixture carefully to combine the liquids but retaining the layers of  potatoes undisturbed.",
    "Slice 1 stick of cold butter over the potatoes and bake them in a preheated, moderately hot oven (350° F.), adding 1 more cup of heavy cream, ¼ cup at a time every 30 minutes.  Bake for two hours.  After the last addition of cream, bake the potatoes for 30 minutes more, or until the liquid is reduced and the potatoes are golden brown.",
    "Let the dish cool a good 10 minutes before bringing to the table."
