  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "6 garlic cloves, unpeeled",
    "3 pounds of small boiling potatoes (white or red skinned)",
    "2 red bell peppers",
    "3½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar",
    "½ cup small fresh basil leaves"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Halve the potatoes and cut the bell peppers into ½ inch pieces.  In a large bowl toss the potatoes, bell peppers, and 3 tablespoons oil with salt and pepper to taste.  Arrange the potatoes and bell peppers in one layer in 2 large shallow baking pans and roast in the middle and lower thirds of the oven.  Occasionally stir the contents of the baking pans and halfway through the roasting time switch the pans, placing the one in the middle in the bottom and the one on the bottom in the middle.  Roast the potatoes until the potatoes are tender and golden brown, about 35 minutes in a preheated oven (450° F.).",
    "Wrap the garlic cloves together in foil and simultaneously roast it on either rack of the oven.",
    "Remove from the oven and in a bowl immediately toss the hot potatoes and peppers with 2 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar.  Remove the garlic from the foil and squeeze the pulp into a small bowl.  With a fork mash the garlic with the remaining oil and balsamic vinegar.  Toss the potatoes and peppers with the garlic mixture and just before serving add the basil, salt and pepper.",
    "Remarks:  The original directions specify that the potatoes be served as a “room temperature”.  However, in my opinion the dish tastes better if it’s served warm.",
    "Yield:  Serves six.",
