  "title": "Orange and Red Onion Salad",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "6 large navel oranges",
    "¼ cup fresh lemon juice",
    "½ cup olive oil",
    "2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves (or chopped fresh chives instead of parsley)",
    "3 red onions, sliced thinly"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Working over a ceramic or glass bowl to catch the juices peel the oranges with serrated knife, slice them crosswise, and chill them on a plate (covered with plastic so they don’t dry out) for 30 minutes, or longer.",
    "In another bowl, large enough to hold all the onions you will be using, place the lemon juice, salt and pepper, then add the oil in a stream, whisking as you pour it in.  Whisk the dressing until it is well emulsified.  Add the chopped parsley or the chives, which ever you are using, and the onions and toss the mixture well.  Like the oranges, cover with plastic, and place the bowl in the refrigerator to chill, and allow the onion to marinade for at least 30 minutes.",
    "To serve, fold the orange slices into the onion mixture and place on the table."
  ],
  "remarks": "This recipe can be cut easily to make smaller quantities (two oranges, one small red onion).  Further, you may wish to substitute sweet yellow onions in place of the red onion.  Finally, if you don’t like the strong flavor of onions, you may wish to begin by slicing the onion and soaking it in salt water for at least an hour before you begin peeling the oranges.",
