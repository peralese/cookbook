  "title": "Carrot and  Salad",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1½ pounds of carrots",
    "2 oranges",
    "1 lemon",
    "2 tablespoons orange-blossom or rose water"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Wash and peel the carrots then grate them into a ceramic bowl.  Peel the oranges and cut them into small pieces.  (This process will release a lot of juice so use a plate rather than a cutting board so that you can reserve the juices.)  Add the orange pieces and the released orange juice to the grated carrots.  Squeeze in the juices of one lemon and add the orange-blossom or rose water.",
    "Toss the mixture and serve.",
    "Remarks:  I remember my grandmother and mother making this salad, less the lemon, orange-blossom or rose water.  It always went over great with my sister and me.  In fact, it was usually served as dessert!  The one thing that we did different than noted in this recipe was that the salad was always refrigerated and served cold.",
    "Yield:  Serves 4.",
