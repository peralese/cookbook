    "In a sieve rinse well the sauerkraut and press it with the back of a spoon to squeeze out as much of the liquid as possible.  In a saucepan sauté the bacon in the lard until the bacon fat is transparent.  Add the onion and sauté it until it is lightly browned.  Add the sauerkraut and stir it until it’s coated with lard then add the wine and beef stock (or beef broth) and cook the mixture, covered, over low heat, stirring occasionally for 3 hours.  Stir in the flour, caraway seed, and add the salt and pepper at this time.  Taste it to insure the salt and pepper suits your taste.",
    "Add the apple slices and continue cooking the mixture for 5 to 10 minutes more, until the apples are tender but still hold their shape.",
    "Yield:  Serves 6 to 8; as an accompaniment for chops and sausages.",
