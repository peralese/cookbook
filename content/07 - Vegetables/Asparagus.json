    "Peel the stalks of the asparagus, trim the stalks so that they are the same length and tie them in bundles of 10 to 12 with the kitchen string.  In a stainless steel or enameled kettle cook the asparagus in boiling salted water to cover for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it is tender but not limp.  Transfer the bundles to a colander, tips up, and refresh them under running cold water.  Pat dry and serve while still warm."
