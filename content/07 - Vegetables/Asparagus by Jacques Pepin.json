  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1½ pounds fresh asparagus spears (about 2 dozen)",
    "½ cup hot tap water",
    "¼ teaspoon salt, plus more if needed for the final result",
    "⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more if needed for the final result",
    "3 tablespoons butter, cut in small pieces",
    "Chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Lay each spear on the work surface, holding the base in the fingers of one hand.  Using a sharp knife or vegetable peeler shave off the fibrous skin, starting just under the tip and peeling towards the base as shown in the photo below.  Rotate the spear as you peel it, leaving the skin in ribbons still attached to the base of the spear.  Snap off the bottom.",
    "Lay all the spears in a large, 12-inch or larger, sauté pan in one or two layers.  Add the hot water, the salt, and pepper then cover the pan and bring it to a boil over high heat.  Cook the spears at a rapid boil for 4 minutes, or until barely tender.  Remove the spears to a serving plate.",
    "Add the butter in pieces to the sauté pan and boil for a minute or two longer, so that the butter emulsifies in the evaporating liquid.  Pour the emulsified mixture over the asparagus, sprinkle with chopped parsley, and serve.",
    "This method of cooking asparagus takes only a couple of minutes at most, so they should be left to just before the end of other preparations."
