  "ingredients": [
    "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 clove garlic, peeled and minced",
    "1 shallot, peeled and minced",
    "2 to 3 teaspoons Dijon-style mustard",

  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a small bowl, whisk together vigorously the salt, pepper, garlic, shallot, mustard, vinegar, and lemon juice until it is frothy; approximately 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "Gradually add the oil in a slow stream, whisking vigorously all the while.  When you have added all the oil, whisk for another moment – the dressing should be quite fluffy – and taste it.  You may wish to adjust the salt, pepper, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice or oil, depending on your tastes and how you’re planning on using the dressing.",
    "If the vinaigrette is not to be used immediately, refrigerate it in a covered jar.  Let the dressing warm up to room temperature and whisk it again just before using."
