  "remarks": "This pineapple cranberry sauce has an intriguing two-fruit flavor that’s accented by some chili sauce and vinegar.  It’s a perfect barbecue sauce brush-on for a ham steak with sweet potatoes.  It also brings out the best in pork, chicken, turkey, sausage, and carrots.  If you like, grill some fresh pineapple slices or peach halves and brush this sauce on the pineapple slices or peach halves the last few minutes. Yield:  Makes 2⅓ cups.
