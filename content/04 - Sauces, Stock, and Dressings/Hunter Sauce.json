  "title": "Hunter’s Sauce (Chasseur Sauce)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 (3-ounce) can chopped mushrooms, drained",
    "1 shallot, finely chopped; or, approximately ¼ cup finely chopped onion",
    "4 tablespoons butter; or, margarine",
    "1 envelope brown gravy mix (brand is not important)",
    "¾ cup water",
    "½ cup red wine, preferably dry",
    "1 tablespoon tomato paste",
    "Fine herbs of one’s personal preference"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a medium sauce pan (1½-quarts) melt the butter over medium heat.  In the butter (or margarine) cook the drained mushrooms and shallot (or onion) until the shallots are translucent and tender but not browned.  Add the envelope of brown gravy mix, the water, the red wine, and the tomato paste and stir to blend and dissolve all the ingredients.  Add the herbs of choice to compliment the dish the sauce it intended for.",
    "Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and bubbles."
  ],
  "remarks": "If you consider classic sauces too complicated and time-consuming, Chasseur Sauce will change you mind.  This recipe has all the traditional ingredients – mushrooms, shallots, wine, and herbs – simmered together in a rich brown gravy.  But it’s made easy since the gravy starts from a prepared mix.  Serve with sliced roast beef and sautéed onions, with meatballs, or stew, over leftover chicken or turkey and dressing; or use in a pot pie. Yield:  Makes 1¾ cups.
