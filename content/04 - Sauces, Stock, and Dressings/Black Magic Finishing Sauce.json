  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "¼ cup soy sauce",
    "1 tablespoon red wine",
    "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients."
  ],
  "remarks": "Dab on this finishing sauce just before taking the meat or vegetables off the fire.  It should only be on the fire, after you’ve added this sauce, for a few seconds.  Use approximately 1 teaspoon for this finishing sauce per 3 ounces of met or vegetables; roughly 2½ to 3 teaspoons for an 8-ounce steak. This sauce is a “natural” flavor enhancer for beef, poultry, fish, all seafood, wild game, and vegetables.  Try it! There is no need to freeze or refrigerate the finishing sauce.  It keeps indefinitely in a covered container at room temperature. Yield:  Makes less than half a cup, enough for six 8-ounce steaks.
