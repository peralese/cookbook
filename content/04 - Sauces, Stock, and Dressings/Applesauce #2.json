  "title": "Applesauce",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 pounds McIntosh apples; or, any other red apples",
    "¾ cup sugar",
    "¼ cup water",
    "½ teaspoon cinnamon"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Wash the apples.  Core and peal the apples and cut them into quarters.  In a large (3-quarts) saucepan, combine the apples, ¼ cup water, the sugar and cinnamon and bring to a boil.  When the ingredients reach a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the apples are very soft – approximately 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and when the apples have cooled enough place them in a blender and puree them in their liquid.  Pour out the pureed apples into a medium-grid colander and press them through it using a wooden spoon.",
    "Taste the applesauce and adjust it for sweetness.  Return the applesauce to the saucepan and cook over medium heat until the newly added sugar is dissolved, approximately 5 minutes.  Serve warm or refrigerate, covered.",
    "Remarks:  You may want to prepare the applesauce without peeling them.  Using red apples, by cooking them unpeeled (just coring and quartering them) will give the applesauce a faint pink tint and also adds flavor.  When you blend the apples and then pass the puree through the colander you will be removing the peeling.",
    "Yield:  Makes about a quart.",
