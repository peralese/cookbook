  "title": "Tomato and Meat Spaghetti Sauce Ynocencio",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 onion, medium to large, chopped",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "3 garlic cloves, minced",
    "½ pound mushrooms, sliced",
    "1¼ pounds lean ground beef",
    "1 28-ounce can of peeled tomatoes, chopped, including the packing juices",
    "1 16-ounce can of tomato sauce",
    "1 6-ounce can of tomato paste",
    "2 cups water",
    "2 tablespoons minced fresh basil leaves",
    "2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leafed parsley leaves",
    "2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "¼ teaspoon black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large heavy sauce pan cook the onion in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook the mixture, stirring, for an additional 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the mushrooms are lightly colored.  Add the ground beef and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the meat no longer shows pink.  Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato sauce, the tomato paste, and all the spices and then add the water and stir the mixture well.  Bring the sauce to a simmer, and simmer it, stirring every 15 minutes, adding more water if it becomes too thick, for 2 hours."

  "remarks": "This is an excellent meat sauce but it needs more salt than the recipe calls for.  You are the judge, make this recipe once then adjust the salt the next time you make it.  I also recommend that the 28-ounce can of whole tomatoes be chopped up in a blender before you add them to the meat.",
