  "title": "Corn Chowder",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 ounces salt pork, cut into small bits",
    "1 large onion, finely chopped",
    "1 celery rib, chopped",
    "3 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into small, ½-inch cubes",
    "2 cups Chicken Stock; or, a low-salt canned chicken stock",
    "1 cup water",
    "3 cups cream-style corn",
    "2 cups milk",
    "¼ cup (½ stick) unsalted butter",
    "Salt and freshly ground pepper (preferably white), to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a separate sauce pan pour in the milk and cut into it the butter and set aside.",
    "In a large heave sauce pan, place the salt pork bits and cook them over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the salt pork is lightly browned; and the fat is rendered, about 3 to 5 minutes under the right heat setting.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until the onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the celery, the potatoes, the chicken stock, and one cup of water.  Cook until the potatoes are cooked through and tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Stir in the corn and cook for an additional 5 minutes.",
    "Within the last 10 to 15 minutes of cooking the corn/chicken stock mixture place the sauce pan with the milk and butter over medium heat and heat until the butter has melted.  When the butter is melted turn the heat down to a bare simmer; or, turn off the heat depending on whether or not you’ve stirred in the corn and have allowed the chowder to cook the “additional” 5 minutes.",
    "After stirring in the corn and cooking the chowder for 5 minutes stir in the milk/butter mixture and add salt and pepper to taste.  Serve hot."
  ],
  "remarks": "This corn chowder can be improved on by making your own cream-style corn. Fresh corn can be cut from the cob and cooked in butter then processed in a food processor; pulsing briefly to cream.",
  "yield": "Serves 6.",
