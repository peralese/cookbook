  "title": "Fideo",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "¼ cup oil",
    "1 5-ounce package “fideo” pasta; or, the thin vermicelli pasta",
    "1 large clove garlic, pressed or finely minced",
    "½ cup finely chopped onion",
    "½ cup finely chopped bell pepper",
    "2½ cups boiling “beef stock”; or, bouillon",
    "½ cup tomato sauce",
    "1 teaspoon ground cumin",
    "1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat.  When the oil is just smoking lower the heat to low and add the pasta.  Cook the pasta, stirring constantly, until it turns light golden brown (this should take less than 5 minutes if done right).  Add the garlic, onion, and bell pepper and cook, stirring constantly, for about 3 more minutes over low heat.  Remove from the heat.",
    "Add the boiling stock, tomato sauce, cumin, and cilantro and return the Dutch oven to the low heat.  Continue cooking, uncovered, over the low heat, stirring once or twice, for about 10 more minutes or until the liquid is barely absorbed.",
    "The fideo should be “moist and slippery” in the bowl when served."
  ],
  "remarks": "This is a favorite Mexican pasta stew, and it tends to cook down … (if not served immediately).  The fideo absorb a lot of the broth but the flavors are fantastic.  It was traditionally cooked outdoors over an open fire during cold weather as lunch for hungry cowboys, to warm the chilled bodies … or even at home for the children’s favorite supper.  This recipe comes from the Armstrong Ranch, where it was a family favorite. Yield:  Serves 6.
