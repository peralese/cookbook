  "title": "Asparagus and Leek Soup",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup finely chopped white and pale green part of leek, washed well",
    "1 garlic clove, minced",
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces",
    "1¼ cups chicken broth",
    "⅓ cup sour cream"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a saucepan cook the leek and the garlic in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until the leek is softened.  When softened, add the asparagus, the broth, and ½ cup water and simmer the mixture, covered for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the asparagus is very tender.  Remove the pan from the fire and let it cool until you can safely pour off a portion and use in a blender.  Take two thirds of the cooked mixture and purée it in a blender until it is very smooth then return it to the remaining mixture in the pan.  Cook the soup over moderately low heat until it is heated through, but do not let it boil, then whisk in the sour cream and add salt and pepper to your taste."
