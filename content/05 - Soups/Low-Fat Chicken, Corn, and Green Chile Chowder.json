  "instructions": [
    "Spray a large saucepan with nonstick cooking spray then set it over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, carrots, celery and the garlic and sauté the vegetables stirring frequently.  Watching the vegetable so that they don’t scorch begin adding some chicken broth, a little at a time, stirring; adding more chicken broth as the previous quantity evaporates.  Continue this process until the vegetables are tender, approximately 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the heat settings.",
    "When the vegetables are tender add all of the remaining chicken broth, the corn, the chopped chicken, and the black pepper and bring everything to a boil and allow it to cook, boiling, for 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "Dissolve the cornstarch in the half-and-half while it’s cold and add it to the soup after you’ve allow it to cook, boiling above for 2 to 3 minutes.  Bring the mixture back to a boil, stirring, then remove from the heat and serve."
