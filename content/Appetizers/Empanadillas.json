  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "½ pound chorizo",
    "1 cup, cooked and diced potatoes",
    "fresh epazote leaves",
    "an egg wash, made by lightly beating together 2 egg yolks and 2 teaspoons of water"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "First make the lard pastry dough, wrap it in wax paper and place it in the refrigerator.",
    "Second, cook the filling for the empanadas.  In a skillet cook the chorizo, over medium heat, breaking it up into a ground beef consistency.  As the chorizo cooks it will release its grease and oils; these should be spooned out.  After the chorizo is cooked, tilt the pan and remove as much of the remaining grease and oils as is possible.  Return the pan to the fire and add the minced potatoes and cook the mixture together for 1 minute, or until the potatoes and chorizo are well blended together.",
    "Roll out the dough ⅛ inch thick on a floured surface and with a 3 inch round cutter cut out rounds.  Divide the chorizo mixture among the rounds, add a little fresh epazote on top of each mound of chorizo, then moisten the edges of each round with water.  Fold the rounds in half, shape them into crescents, and crimp the edges with a fork.",
    "Arrange the crescents on a lightly greased baking sheet, brush them with the egg wash, and bake them in a preheated hot oven (400° F.), brushing them frequently with the egg wash for 20 minutes, or until they are golden.",
    "Transfer the Empanadillas to a heated platter and serve.",
    "Yield:  Makes about two dozen.",
