    "Remove the chiles, onion, and garlic from the saucepan with a slotted spoon and place them in a food processor.  Add the brown sugar, cumin, oregano, tomato paste, and one cup of the liquid the chiles were cooked in.  Purée, adding more of the liquid the chiles were cooked in until you reach the consistency of Ketchup, or your individual preferred thickness.  Stop the blender and taste the mixture; add more brown sugar if desired.",
