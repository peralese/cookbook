  "title": "Curried Vegetable Sauce",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 medium size onion, finely chopped (about ½ cup, at least)",
    "1 small green bell pepper, finely sliced in inch-long slivers (about the same quantity as onion)",
    "2 tablespoons butter or margarine",
    "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour",
    "2 to 3 teaspoons curry powder (try it the first time; adjust the quantity subsequently)",
    "¼ teaspoon salt",
    "½ cup milk",
    "1 teaspoon instant chicken bouillon granules",
    "½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce",
    "2 tablespoons chopped pimento",
    "Chopped parsley, optional"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a medium sauce pan (1½-quarts) melt the butter over medium heat.  In the butter (or margarine) cook the onion and bell pepper until the onions are translucent and tender but not browned.  Stir in the flour, curry powder, and the salt until well mixed then add the milk, the water, the chicken bouillon, and the Worcestershire sauce.  Cook the sauce over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is bubbly and beginning to thicken.",
    "Lastly, stir in the chopped pimento.  From this point on, allow the sauce to remain on the heat only long enough to have the pimento to heat through and remove from the heat.",
    "Sprinkle chopped fresh parsley on the sauce when served."
  ],
  "remarks": "You can set the mood for a “Far Eastern” feast with this sauce that’s packed with onions, bell pepper, and pimentos.  If you prefer more pronounced seasonings, you can use higher levels of curry powder in this recipe.  One can call on this sauce to serve, and go well with, pork, lamb, and fish; or, serve it with white rice.  It will also go well with green beans and broccoli spears. Yield:  Makes 1½ cups.
