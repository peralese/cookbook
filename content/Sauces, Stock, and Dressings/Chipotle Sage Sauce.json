    "6 dried chipotles (approximately 1½ ounces) seeded",
    "½ stick (¼ cup) unsalted butter",
    "⅔ cup thinly sliced white part of green onions",

    "In a saucepan cover the chipotles with water and bring the water to a boil, then simmer the chilies for 15 minutes or until they are tender.  Transfer the chipotles to a blender, add some of the water, and blend them until you have a consistency of tomato paste.  In another saucepan melt the butter over moderately high heat and add 2 tablespoons of the purée.  (Reserve any unused chipotle purée for another use in a closed container in the freezer.)  Also add the green onions, the sage, and the garlic and cook the mixture, stirring, for 5 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced to about one cup.",
