  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 cups sugar",
    "1 teaspoon baking soda",
    "Pinch of salt",
    "1 cup buttermilk",
    "2 tablespoons butter",
    "1½ cups coarsely chopped pecans",
    "1 teaspoon vanilla"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large saucepan, combine the sugar, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk.  Quickly bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly, until the mixture takes on a creamy texture (about 210º F. on a candy thermometer).  At this point add the butter and pecans and cook over medium heat, stirring until the candy thermometer reaches 234º to 238º F., or the “soft ball” stage occurs.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly and add the vanilla.  Beat with a wooden spoon until the mixture loses its “gloss”.  Using a pair of spoons, the wooden spoon and another, quickly drop portions of the mixture in mounds on wax paper and let it cool.",
    "If you’re not going to eat the pralines all in one day wrap them individually and store in a air tight container.",
    "Remarks:  The making of pralines can take forever on a rainy day, so it best to keep an eye on the weather when making the pralines.",
    "Yield:  Makes 12 to 15 pralines.",
