  "remarks": "The pie may be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, but don’t freeze as the pumpkin filling will separate from the pie crust. Serve with a dollop of whipping cream; or for a difference, try serving with Harrod’s “Hard Sauce”.  For the “Hard Sauce” see the recipe in the “Sauces, Stock, and Dressings” folder.
