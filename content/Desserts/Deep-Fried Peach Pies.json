  "requires": "Lard pastry dough, see “Breads, Cakes, and Pastries.",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 cups dried peaches",
    "water",
    "¼ to ⅓ cup sugar"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Put two cups of dried peaches in a large heavy saucepan and add enough water to cover them by ½ -inch.  Bring the water to a boil and simmer the peaches for 25 minutes, or until they are tender and plump.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the sugar; taste to verify the sweetness and let the mixture cool.  Drain the peaches and chop them coarsely.",
    "Halve the dough and roll out each half ⅛ inch thick on a floured surface, and from each half cut out six rounds with a 6-inch cutter.  Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of the peaches onto half of each round and brush the edges of the dough with water.  Fold the dough over the filling to form half circles, press the edges together, and seal them with the tines of a fork.  Chill the completed pies for at least 20 minutes, or until they are firm.",
    "In a deep fryer fry the pies, 3 at a time, in 3 inches of hot vegetable oil (375° F.) turning them once or twice, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are golden.  Transfer the pies with a skimmer to paper towels to drain and sprinkle them with powder sugar.",
    "Yield:  Makes 12 pies.",
