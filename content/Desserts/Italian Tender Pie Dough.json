  "title": "Italian Tender Pie Dough (Pasta Frolla)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "⅓ cup sugar",
    "½ teaspoon baking powder",
    "¼ teaspoon salt",
    "1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter or 4 ounces cold lard, cut into 8 pieces",
    "2 large eggs, lightly beaten"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Put the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade; pulse a few times just to mix the ingredients.  Add the butter and pulse 15 to 20 times, or until the mixture resembles fine cornmeal.  With the machine running, add the eggs and process until the dough forms a ball on the blade, about a minute or so.",
    "Remove the dough from processor and knead it, folding it over on itself, until it is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.  Wrap the dough in plastic and set it aside for up to 30 minutes, or chill until its needed.",
    "Use the dough in any pie or tort recipe."
  ],
  "remarks": "The dough can be made up to 3 days ahead, wrapped well and refrigerated, or frozen, tightly wrapped, for up to a month.  Thaw, still wrapped in the refrigerator. If you are new to making piecrusts, this is a good starter dough.  It’s a “made-in-the-food-processor” dough that’s almost indestructible.  And because of the relatively large amount of sugar, you don’t have to worry about overworking it, nor do you need to be concerned if it cracks, as it goes into the pie plate, it’s fixable. Yield:  Makes enough dough for one 9-inch, lattice-topped, pie.
