    "2 cups warm water (105˚ - 115˚ F.)",
    "2 packages Active Dry Yeast",
    "½ cup sugar",
    "2 teaspoons salt",
    "¼ cup ( ½ stick) softened butter or margarine",

  "instructions": [
    "Measure the warm water into a large warm bowl.  Sprinkle in the yeast and stir until dissolved.  Add the sugar, 2 teaspoons salt, the butter (or margarine), the egg and 3 cups of flour.  Beat with an electric beater the mixture is smooth.  At which point you add the additional flour until you get a stiff dough.  Coat the inside of the bowl with butter or some Mazola None Stick spray and return the dough back inside the bowl and cover tightly with Saran Wrap and place in the refrigerator.  Refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours.",
    "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board.  Divide in half, then cut each half into 16 equal size pieces.  Roll each piece into pencil shapes about 20 inches long.  Then take each string of dough and shape into pretzels.  Place the pretzels on a lightly greased baking sheet.  When you have all the pretzels placed, blend together the egg yolk and two tablespoons water, and brush each pretzel top with the mixture.  Sprinkle with coarse salt.  Cut a piece of  wax paper to fit across the top of the baking sheet and spray it with the Mazola spray and lay it across the top of the pretzels.  Cover this with a cloth towel and place in a warm place, free of air drafts, and let the pretzels rise until double in bulk, about 25 minutes.",
    "Bake in a hot 400˚ F. oven for about 15 minutes, or until browned and done.  Remove from the baking sheets and cool on wire racks."
