    "2 cups boiling water",
    "1 cup quick-cooking oats",
    "2 packages (¼ ounces, each) active dry yeast",
    "¼ cup warm water (between 110º and 115º F.)",
    "2 eggs, beaten",
    "½ cup molasses",
    "½ cup vegetable oil",

  "instructions": [
    "In a large mixing bowl, combine the boiling water and the “quick-cooking” oats; mix then set aside to allow the mixture to begin cooling to between 110º and 115º F.  Meanwhile, dissolve the yeast in the ¼ cup of warm water (between 110º and 115º F.).  When the oats mixture has cooled down to the temperature range indicated stir the dissolved yeast.  Add the beaten eggs, molasses, oil, sugar, and the salt; stir to mix.  Then add just enough of the flour to make a soft dough.  Once you have a soft dough turn it out onto a floured surface and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic; this should take about 6 to 8 minutes of kneading.  Place the dough in a greased (or buttered) bowl, turning it to coat the top of the dough with the grease (or butter).  Cover with a piece of plastic and let the dough rise in a warm place until it double in volume; this should take about an hour.",
    "Punch down the dough and divided it into 36 pieces.  Shape the individual pieces in round balls and place them on greased baking sheets.  Cover them and let them rise until they double in volume; about 30 minutes.",
    "Preheat the oven to 375 º F.",
    "Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  Brush them with the melted butter when you take them out of the oven.  Allow them to cool on wire racks."
