  "title": "Creamed Corn Muffins",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup all-purpose flour",
    "1 cup yellow cornmeal",
    "1 tablespoon sugar",
    "1 tablespoon double-acting baking powder",
    "1½ teaspoon salt",
    "1 large egg, beaten lightly",
    "½ cup milk",
    "½ stick (¼ cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled",
    "An 8½-ounce can of cream-style corn"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Into a bowl sift together the flour, the cornmeal, the sugar, the baking powder, and the salt.  In another bowl combine the egg, the milk, the butter, and the corn.",
    "Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir the mixtures together lightly.  The batter will be lumpy.  Spoon the batter into buttered ½-cup muffin tins, filling them ⅞ full, and bake them in the middle of a preheated hot oven (425° F.) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.  Transfer the muffins to a napkin-lined basket.",
    "Remarks:  Paper muffin cup fillers may also be used to save making a mess in the muffin tins.  When I use paper fillers I give each a quick squirt of PAM© and the paper cups peel off the muffin easily.",
    "Yield:  Makes about 12 muffins.",
