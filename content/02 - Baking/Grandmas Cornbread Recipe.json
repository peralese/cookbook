  "title": "Grandma’s Cornbread Recipe",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup flour",
    "1 cup yellow corn meal flour",
    "1 egg",
    "3 teaspoons baking powder",
    "¼ cup sugar",
    "6 tablespoons corn oil; or, bacon drippings",
    "⅔ cup milk (may need more, but the batter must be thick)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Grease, or butter, a pan (7 by 12 by 1½-inches) before you start (It needs to be “well” greased or “well” buttered.  Pam® spray “won’t do”).  Begin preheating the oven to 450° F. and five to eight minutes before you finish the batter (about the point you are going to break the egg) place the greased or buttered pan in the oven and let it heat up.",
    "Mix the two flours, salt, sugar, and baking powder together in a large mixing bowl.  Beat the egg in a bowl then stir it into the milk and oil (or bacon drippings).  Add the liquids to the flour mixture and mix it all together with a wooden spoon, or a whisk, until you get a thick batter.  Do not over mix.",
    "When the batter is done remove the hot pan, the grease or butter should be melted and quite hot, and place it on a heat resistant surface where you can pour the batter into it without burning yourself.  Pour the cornbread batter into the pan, extend it with a spatula or the wooden spoon if necessary, and return the pan to the preheated oven.  Bake the cornbread at 450° F. for 20 to 25 minutes; or, until it’s a light golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out dry.",
    "Remarks:  This recipe was given to me while I was living on my own in Pacific Grove, CA by my mom.  It was part of a letter she sent me in which she responded to my request for the recipe for her cornbread dressing.  The date would have been approximately November 1968."
