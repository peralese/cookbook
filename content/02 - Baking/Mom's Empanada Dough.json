  "title": "Mom’s Empanada Dough",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 Cups unbleached flour",
    "Approximately ½ cup water (may require less, do not pour it in all at once)",
    "2 teaspoons baking powder",
    "1/3 cup sugar",
    "1 stick of butter"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 400º F.",
    "Combine the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt) and mix well.  Cut in the butter until it has been well incorporated into the flour.  Finally, add the cold water a little bit at a time and work it in until you have pliable dough.  The dough should NOT be “sticky.”",
    "With floured hands divide the dough into about 10 to 12 balls.  Roll out each dough ball as you would a small tortilla and in the center of each put some of the apple sauce.  Fold them in half and press the edges together to seal the empanadas.  (You might want to moisten the edges of the dough before you fold them over as the moisture will help the dough seal better (wet your finger and run it all around the edge) and you might also use the tines of a fork to press the dough together.)",
    "Place the empanadas on a baking sheet and bake them for about 20 minutes in the preheated oven.  (You might wish to use a sheet of parchment paper on the baking sheet in case an empanada \"leaks\" and save yourself some effort in cleaning up.)"
