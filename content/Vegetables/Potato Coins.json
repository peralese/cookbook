  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 russet (baking) potatoes, about ½ pound each, well scrubbed, patted dry, and pricked",
    "with a fork",
    "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1 large egg yolk",
    "½ teaspoon salt, or to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Bake the potatoes in the middle of a preheated oven set at 400º F. for 1 hour, or until they test soft when pricked with a toothpick.",
    "When the potatoes are cool enough to handle cut them in half a scoop them out, discarding the skins.  Force the potato pulp through a ricer sot over a bowl.  In another bowl combine well 1 cup, firmly packed, of the potato pulp, reserving the remaining pulp for another use, with 1 tablespoon of the butter, softened, the egg yolk, and the salt.  Knead the mixture with floured hands on a lightly floured surface until it forms a smooth paste.  On the floured surface, using a rolling pin, roll out the paste ⅓ inch thick and, using a small 1½-inch round biscuit cutter, cut the paste into rounds.",
    "In a large heavy skillet heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in it sauté the potato rounds in batches, turning them, until both sides are golden brown.",
    "Yield:  Makes about 24 potato coins.",
