Note: If you don’t want to make the batter from scratch, use our Irondale Cafi Original Whistlestop™ Recipes Brand Fried Green Tomato Batter Mix. Note: Another way to batter green tomatoes is to dip them into beaten egg or buttermilk, drain off excess liquid, and dip them into a mixture of flour and cornmeal. Fry in bacon drippings or hot oil; drain in colander before serving. Note: The tomatoes can also be deep-fried in hot oil until golden brown and then drained in colander.",
