  "title": "Broccoli with Breadcrumbs",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound broccoli, separated into its small flowerets, chopped smaller if need be",
    "3 tablespoons olive oil",
    "½ onion, minced",
    "1 clove garlic, minced",
    "¾ cup of breadcrumbs"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a small skillet, heat the olive oil and when it’s hot sauté the onion until it’s translucent.  When the onion has been sautéed add the garlic and the breadcrumbs.  Toast the breadcrumbs until all the oil has been absorbed, then set the mixture aside but keeping it warm.",
    "In a separate saucepan add enough water to cover the broccoli and bring it to a boil, covered.  When the water is boiling, add in the broccoli, cover, and steam it for 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain the water, place the broccoli in a serving dish and pour the breadcrumbs over it and serve."
  ],
  "remarks": "I strongly object to over cooked broccoli.  While this recipe calls for cooked broccoli what makes me include it here is that it calls for the broccoli to be drained and served immediately.  I suspect that the cooking process will be stopped this way and the dish won’t suffer from over cooked broccoli. I suspect that this dish would be excellent if the broccoli were stir-fried instead of cooked, as this recipe calls for. Yield:  Serves 4.
