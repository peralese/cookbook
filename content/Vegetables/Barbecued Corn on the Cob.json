  "title": "Barbecued Corn on the Cob Requires:  This recipe requires “Texas Sprinkle” which is in the “Miscellaneous” < “Odds and Ends” folder.",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 ear of corn, shucked",
    "½ teaspoon Texas Sprinkle",
    "1 tablespoon butter, at room temperature",
    "1 tablespoon prepared barbecue sauce"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Rub the corn first with the Texas Sprinkle, then with the butter, and finally with the barbecue sauce.",
    "Wrap the ear of corn in aluminum foil.",
    "Roast in a 350° F. oven for 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove the corn from the oven and allow it to continue to tenderize while you prepare the rest of the meal.",
    "When you’re ready to eat, unwrap the foil and serve the corn hot."
  ],
  "remarks": "Of course you’ll want to extrapolate this recipe to meet the needs of the number of people you’re cooking for. You may also roast the corn over medium coals for 10 to 15 minutes, turning it frequently, until the corn is slightly tender.  Once it’s slightly tender, move the corn to a corner of the grill away from any direct flame and away from the main radiated heat of the mass of charcoals.  (Use a heat pad to hold the corn while you test it to see if it’s tender.  You should be able to feel a slight “give” through the foil.  If you remain unsure of the corn’s “doneness” unwrap the foil and carefully press down on the corn kernels, they should “hot” to the touch and easily burst with a fingernail.) This same technique may be used with zucchini squash.  Simply quarter the squash crosswise and follow the directions above. Yield:  Makes 1 serving.
