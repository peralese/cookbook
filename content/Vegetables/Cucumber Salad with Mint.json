  "title": "Cucumber Salad with Mint (Khiar bel Na’na)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 English cucumber, peeled and sliced very thinly",
    "Salt",
    "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "2 tablespoons lemon juice or 1 tablespoon wine vinegar",
    "1 teaspoon orange-blossom water; or, to taste",
    "1 tablespoon dried mint leaves, crushed"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Peel and slice the cucumber as thinly as possible (without wasting undue amount of time).  Sprinkle salt on the sliced cucumber and place in a colander.  Allow the cucumber slices to drain for a half to one full hour.  (Most of the salt will run off with the water as the cucumber drains but if you are concerned with the saltiness then rinse and drain them before mixing them with the rest of the ingredients.)",
    "Place the drained cucumbers in a ceramic bowl and add the remaining ingredients.  Toss to mix the salad well and serve.",
    "Yield:  Serves 4.",
