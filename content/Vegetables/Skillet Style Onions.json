  "remarks": "Skillet Style Onions are a side dish with the advantage that it doesn’t have the famous, “Onion Bite”.  It’s an excellent accompaniment for steaks, chicken, and even fish.  It’s also great as a garnish on outdoors grilled hamburgers, where you want to “taste” the full flavor of the grilled meat without masking it with mustard and other typical hamburger ingredients. Yield:  Makes 4 to 6 servings.
