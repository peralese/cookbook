    "Peel the cucumbers. Holding a fork with tines facing down, drag the tines down the length of the cucumber to score them before slicing.  Slice the scored cucumbers into 1/4-inch slices.  Toss sliced cucumbers with salt in a large mixing bowl. Place slices in a colander or sieve over a mixing bowl to drain for 1 hour.",
    "Pour the juice into a small mixing bowl and add the balsamic vinegar and fresh mint.",
