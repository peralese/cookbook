  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "One pastry crust, 9-inch single-crust pie",
    "5 cups peeled, sliced peaches (5 to 6 large peaches)",
    "½ to ¾ cup sugar (depends on how sweet the peaches happen to be)",
    "2½ to 3 tablespoons of cornstarch",
    "Dash of ground nutmeg",
    "1 egg white, lightly beaten",
    "1 tablespoon lemon juice",
    "⅛ teaspoon almond extract",
    "⅓ cup packed light brown sugar",
    "½ cup flour",
    "6 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1 cup chopped nuts (equal parts pecans and almonds)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat oven to 425º F.",
    "Mix the light brown sugar with the flour.  Cut in the butter and work it in until the mixture is crumbly.  Stir in the nuts and set aside.",
    "Line a 9-inch pie plate with the pie crust and lightly brush the uncooked pie shell with a thin layer of the egg white to moisture-proof it.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the sliced peaches, sugar, cornstarch, and nutmeg.  Stir the mixture and allow it to stand for 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes stir in the lemon juice and almond extract into the peach mixture and spoon the mixture into the pie shell.  Spread the peach mixture evenly into the pie crust then sprinkle the nut mixture over the peaches.",
    "Place the pie in the center rack of the hot oven and bake for 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes reduce the heat to 400º and bake for 35 minutes more.  To prevent over-browning of the rim of the pie crust, cover the edges with strips of foil.",
