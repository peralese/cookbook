  "title": "Pastry Dough Tart Shell",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1¾ cups all-purpose flour",
    "1 stick (½ cup) cold, unsalted butter",
    "2 tablespoons vegetable shortening",
    "½ teaspoon salt"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large bowl blend together the flour, the butter, the shortening, and the salt with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles corn meal.  Add 4 tablespoons ice water, toss the mixture until the water is incorporated, and form the dough in a ball.  Chill the dough, wrapped well in wax paper and flattened slightly, for 1 hour.",
    "Roll out the dough ⅛-inch thick on a lightly floured surface.  Use the rolling pin to transfer the dough into an 11-inch tart pan, with a removable fluted rim, leaving a 1-inch overhang.  Fold the overhang inwards, pressing it against the side of the shell so the dough stands slightly above the edge of the pan.  Prick the bottom of the shell lightly with a fork and chill the shell for 30 minutes.  Line the shell with foil, fill the foil with rice, and bake the shell in the lower third of a preheated oven (425° F.)  for 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove the foil and rice carefully and bake the empty shell for 5 to 7 minutes more, or until it is pale golden brown.  Let the shell cool in the pan on a rack.",
    "The tart shell may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered at room temperature.",
    "Yield:  One 11-inch tart pastry shell.",
