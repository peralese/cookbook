    "Pre-heat the oven to 375º F.",
    "Using a blender beat the softened cream cheese with ⅓ cup of sugar, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and the salt until the mixture is thick and creamy.  Spread this mixture in the bottom of a prepared pie crust and sprinkle the pecans on top then set aside.",
    "Mix, by hand, the remaining 3 eggs, ¼ cup sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and the corn syrup until the mixture is well blended.  Pour this mixture over the pecans carefully and slowly so as to not disturb the loose pecans too much.",
