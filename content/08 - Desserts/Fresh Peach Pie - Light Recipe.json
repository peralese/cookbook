  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "8 to 9 fresh peaches, peeled and sliced",
    "3 tablespoons cornstarch",
    "⅔ cup sugar",
    "½ cup water",
    "⅛ teaspoon almond extract"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Take 1 or 2 of the sliced peaches, enough to make 1½ cups, and place them in a saucepan.  Mash them with a potato masher until the peaches are pureed as much as possible.  Add the cornstarch and sugar and stir until the sugar and cornstarch are dissolved in the pureed peaches.",
    "Place the saucepan over medium heat and add the water.  Cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until it thickens.  It will reach the boiling point before the mixture thickens.  You also need to note that the mixture will go from cloudy to clear when it’s ready.  Add and stir in the almond extract only after the mixture is clear and has thickened.  Set the finished mixture aside to cool.",
    "When the mixture has cooled add the sliced peaches and stir; until the sliced peaches are well coated with the mixture.  Pour the mixture into the prepared pie crust and place in the refrigerator to firm up.",
    "Serve with a whipped cream topping.",
    "Yield:  Makes 1 (9-inch) pie; approximately 8 servings.",
