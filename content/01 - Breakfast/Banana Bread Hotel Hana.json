  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 stick  (½ cup) unsalted butter, softened",
    "1 cup sugar",
    "2 large eggs",
    "3 very ripe bananas",
    "2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "1 teaspoon baking soda",
    "¼ cup chopped macadamia nuts"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Into a bowl sift together the flour and the baking soda and set aside.  In a separate large bowl cream together 1 stick of unsalted butter, softened, with 1 cup sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, then add 2 large eggs and 3 very ripe bananas, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the flour mixture to the banana mixture, and combine the batter well.  At the very end add the chopped macadamia nuts and pour the batter into a buttered loaf pan, 8 by 4 by 2½ inches, and bake it in a preheated moderate oven (350° F.) for 1 hour, or until a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Let the bread cool on a rack for 20 minutes, turn it out of the pan onto the rack, let it cool completely before slicing it.",
    "Remarks:  Instead of macadamia nuts (too expensive for all the times one wants to make this recipe) use ¼ cup chopped pecans and ¼ cup of raisins.  You might also want to let the raisins plump up by soaking them in rum for a half hour before adding them to the batter.",
    "Yield:  1 loaf of banana bread.",
