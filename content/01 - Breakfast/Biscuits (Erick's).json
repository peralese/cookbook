  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 ½ cups all-purpose flour",
    "2 tablespoon baking powder",
    "1 tablespoon granulated sugar",
    "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "½ c. (1 stick) butter, very cold",
    "1 cup cold buttermilk"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat oven to 425º.  Fifteen minutes before starting put butter in freezer.   You want the butter cold.   In food processor, add together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.  Pulse to mix.",
    "Cut butter into 1 tablespoon slices and add to food processor.  Pulse several times until mixture resembles coarse grainy consistency.   Add flour mixture to large bowl, then make a well in the middle of the dough and pour in 1 cup buttermilk. Stir until just beginning to come together, then dump out onto your work surface.",
    "Bring your dough together into a rectangle, about 1” thick. Fold the dough into thirds, like folding a letter to put into an envelope. Using a rolling pin, gently pat back into a 1” thick rectangle, and repeat the folding process two more times. Work fast so the butter does not melt.",
    "Once dough is folded three times, roll into a 1” thick rectangle again. Using a 2½” round biscuit or cookie cutter, quickly press down (don’t twist!) to cut out the biscuits and place onto baking sheet, about a half inch apart. Bring together dough scraps and cut out more biscuits.",
    "Bake until flaky and tops are lightly golden, about 15 minutes."
