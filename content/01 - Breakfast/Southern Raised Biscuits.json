  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 packages ( ¼ ounce) dry yeast",
    "2 cups buttermilk",
    "¼ cup warm water (105° to 115° F.)",
    "5 cups all-purpose flour",
    "⅓ cup sugar",
    "1 tablespoon baking powder",
    "1 teaspoon baking soda",
    "1¼ teaspoon salt",
    "1 cup shortening or unsalted butter"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Combine yeast and warm water and let stand 5 minutes or until bubbly.  Add buttermilk and set aside.  Combine the dry ingredients.  Cut in the shortening (or butter).  The mix should have a cornmeal grainy texture.  Add the buttermilk and yeast mixture gradually, gently combining with a fork.",
    "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead lightly 4 or 5 times.  Roll the dough into ½ inch thickness, cut and place the rounds on a greased baking sheet.  Cover and let rise for one hour.  Bake at 450° F. for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the biscuits are lightly browned.",
    "To freeze, bake only about 6 minutes, cool, and freeze in an airtight wrap.  Then finish baking on a greased baking sheet art 450° F., for about more 6 minutes, or until browned."
  ],
  "remarks": "The dough will spread or hold its shape while rising depending on how balanced the wet/dry ingredients were.  It takes practice.  Also, when you cover them to let them raise use a greased sheet of waxed paper so that the dough doesn’t stick to the cover.  Finally, you may wish to coat the top of the biscuits with milk or butter prior to placing them in the oven for baking. Yield:  30 plus large sized biscuits.
