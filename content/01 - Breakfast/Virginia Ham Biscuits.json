  "title": "Virginia Ham Biscuits",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "Mrs. Booth’s Biscuit Mix",
    "Milk as needed, 3 to 4 tablespoons per cup of Mrs. Booth’s Biscuit Mix",
    "Flour for kneading",
    "Melted unsalted butter; or, milk for brushing the tops of the biscuits",
    "1¼ to 1½ pounds of Virginia ham, very thinly sliced"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 425° F. and grease or use spray oil, such as Pam®, two large baking sheets.",
    "If you are going to use melted butter to brush the top of the biscuits then before starting melt 4 to 6 tablespoons of butter in a small heat-proof container and set it aside.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, place the biscuit mix.  Using a fork, stir in enough milk to make soft, but not sticky, dough, approximately 3 to 4 tablespoons of milk per cup of mix.  Knead on a lightly floured work surface 5 or 6 times; or, until the dough is smooth and elastic.",
    "With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to ¼-inch thickness, than fold over so that the biscuits will open easily when baked.  With a biscuit cutter, cut out biscuit rounds that are 1½ to 2 inches in diameter (smaller for cocktail size biscuits) and arrange them on the baking sheets.  Brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter; or, with milk.",
    "Bake the biscuits for 7 to 10 minutes; or, until they are golden brown.",
    "Open the biscuits and place some ham inside.",
    "Serve warm.",
    "Yield:  Makes 40 regular biscuits; or, approximately 70 cocktail biscuits.",
