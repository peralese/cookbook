  "remarks": "[By the author:]  “Besides being great on egg roll, soy sauce is one of those secret ingredients that chefs use to wake up the flavor of all kinds of food.  Agua Negra is great for basic backyard barbecued steaks, and chicken, too – just marinate 1 hour to overnight.  Thinly sliced flank steak, marinated in this sauce, grilled over charcoal, and served on a soft tortilla, with all the fixin’s, put Chevys’ steak fajitas on the map.”",
