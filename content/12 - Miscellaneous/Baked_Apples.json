  "title": "Baked Apples",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "6 large red apples like Rome Beauty, Cortland, or Gala",
    "The Juice and the zest of 1 lemon",
    "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened",
    "3 tablespoons dark brown sugar",
    "¼ cup dried currents",
    "¼ cup broken pieces of walnuts, toasted",
    "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "½ cup apple cider",
    "½ cup dark rum"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 400° F.\tSlice off about ¼-inch of the top of each apple.  Scoop out the seeds and core of the apple using a melon-ball tool or simply a potato peeler, being careful not to punch through the bottom of each apple.  Peel off about ½-inch band of the apple’s skin along the upper half of the apple and brush the peeled part, and inside of the apple, with the lemon juice.\tIn a small bowl, combine the butter, lemon zest, brown sugar, and cinnamon before adding the currants and nuts.  With a spoon fill the apples with this mixture and place them in an ovenproof baking dish, just large enough to hold all of the apples upright.  Pour in the cider and rum into the baking dish.  Bake the apples until they are tender, about 30 minutes.  As the apples are baking use a “bulb baster” and baste the apples 2 or 3 times.\tServe the apples warm, or at room temperature, with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream."
