  "title": "Potato and Bacon Soup",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "6 slices maple-cured (or sugar-cured) bacon, diced",
    "6 scallions, finely sliced",
    "1 onion, finely chopped",
    "1 small carrot, peeled and finely chopped",
    "2 garlic cloves",
    "2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and finely chopped",
    "6 cups chicken broth",
    "1 cup heavy cream",
    "Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste",
    "Dash of Worcestershire sauce",
    "6 to 8 fresh parsley sprigs"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Heat a large saucepan, add the bacon, and sauté over medium high heat until crisp and fully cooked.  Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan, and drain on paper towels.  When it is cool, crumble the bacon and set aside.  Add the scallions, onion, carrot, and garlic to the same pan and sauté for 5 minutes.   Add the potatoes, toss well with the vegetables, and add the broth.  Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for about 15 minutes, until the potatoes are fork tender.  Transfer the ingredients to a blender in batches.  With the machine running, add the cream, and when the soup is completely smooth, season with salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce, bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally.  Ladle the soup into serving bowls and garnish with the reserved crumbled bacon and the parsley sprigs.  \tRemove and discard the chipotle chili, if used.  Ladle the soup into warmed bowls and garnish each serving with a pinch of cilantro and fresh onion in the center of the bowl.  Squeeze a wedge of lime into the bowl, then drop the wedge into the bowl and serve.",
