  "title": "Sopa de Fideo",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 package of fideo (vermicelli noodles)",
    "3 tablespoons corn oil",
    "1 medium onion, chopped",
    "2 cups chicken broth",
    "1 14-ounce can of tomato puree; or, 2 fresh tomatoes peeled and pureed in a blender",
    "1 clove garlic, minced",
    "A pinch of ground cumin",
    "1 serrano chile, (optional)",
    "1 potato, cooked and cubed (optional)",
    "Cooked, leftover meat, cubed (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a medium size pan heat the oil and sweat the onion until it is translucent.  Add the garlic then break up the fideo (the vermicelli) and brown it.  The fideo should be “golden brown” not burnt.  When you have the fideo the color you want add the other ingredients and simmer under low heat for about 30 minutes.",
    "If you are adding the optional ingredients add them after the cooking time above.  Continue simmering the soup, stirring occasionally, until the potato and leftover meat have been heated through.",
    "If the soup becomes too thick add more chicken broth before serving.",
    "Remarks:  This is a standard soup that Abby makes.  However, she doesn’t add the optional ingredients; instead she likes to serve this soup on cool days with chorizo and tortillas.  There is nothing better than “tacos de chorizo” with a bowl of “fideo” soup on a cold day.",
    "Yield:  Serves 4 to 6.",
