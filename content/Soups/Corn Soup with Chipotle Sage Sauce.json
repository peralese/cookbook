  "title": "Corn Soup with Chipotle-Sage Sauce Requires:  Chipotle-Sage Sauce, see the Miscellaneous Folder for the recipe.",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 onions, chopped course (about 3 cups)",
    "1 stick (½ cup) unsalted butter",
    "8 cups corn kernels (about 16 ears of fresh corn or 4 frozen 10-ounce packages, thawed)",
    "6 cups chicken broth",
    "¾ cup buttermilk",
    "fresh ground white pepper to taste",
    "salt to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a kettle cook the onions in the butter over moderate heat, stirring, for 5 minutes.  Add the corn and cook the mixture, stirring, for another 5 minutes.  Add the broth and bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to keep the soup at a simmer and cover and simmer the soup, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.  Remove the kettle from the heat and cool the mixture enough so that you can purée it in a blender.  Once cool enough to work, purée the mixture in batches, transferring it back to the cleaned kettle.",
    "Return the kettle to moderate heat and whisk in the buttermilk and season with white pepper and salt.  Heat the soup until it is hot, but do not let it boil again.",
    "Ladle the soup into bows and top each bowl with a dollop of the chipotle-sage sauce.  Serve the remaining chipotle-sage sauce in a separate bowl for those who may wish to add addition sauce to their soup.  You may also garnish the bowls, as you bring to the table, with fresh sage leaves.",
    "Yield:  Serves 8.",
