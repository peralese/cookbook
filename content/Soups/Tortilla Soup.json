    "In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the vegetable oil.  In it cook the diced onion until it is golden brown, stirring occasionally, approximately 15 minutes.  Just before the onion is done add the salt, garlic, and the chipotle chili, if using, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer.  Then add the salsa and chicken stock and bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for about 20 minutes to blend all the flavors.  Lastly, add the tortilla chips and continue simmering until the chips soften and begin to break apart, about 10 to 15 minutes longer.",
    "Remove and discard the chipotle chili, if used.  Ladle the soup into warmed bowls and garnish each serving with a pinch of cilantro and fresh onion in the center of the bowl.  Squeeze a wedge of lime into the bowl, then drop the wedge into the bowl and serve.",
