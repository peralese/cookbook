  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "8 boneless, skinless, chicken breasts",
    "2 cloves garlic, chopped",
    "1 small onion, cut in quarters",
    "2 stalks celery, cut in chunks",
    "Salt, to taste",
    "1 (7-ounce) can salsa verde",
    "1 pound fresh tomatillos; or, 1 (11-ounce) can tomatillos",
    "1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place the chicken breasts, the garlic, onion, and celery in a large saucepan; or, preferably a Dutch oven.  Add enough water to cover the ingredients and lastly pour in the salt.  Set the saucepan (Dutch oven) over medium heat and bring the liquid to a boil; cover the pot and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Cook the chicken for 90 minutes; or, until the chicken is very tender.",
    "Set a large strainer over a large bowl and drain the broth from the solids; reserve the broth.  Separate the chicken from the vegetable solids and when itâ€™s cool enough to handle cut it into small pieces.",
    "Place the chicken pieces in large skillet (or pot) and pour enough of the broth to just cover the quantity of chicken in the skillet (or pot).  Add the canned salsa verde, tomatillos and chopped cilantro and bring all the ingredients to a simmer over low heat; stirring.  Simmer over low heat, stirring to mix all the ingredients.",
    "Remarks:  I may be tempted to thicken the broth mixture if the salsa verde, tomatillos, and chopped cilantro mixture turns out too thin.",
    "Yield:  Serves 8.",
