  "title": "Stuffed Corn Bread",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound lean ground beef",
    "1 cup yellow cornmeal",
    "1 tablespoon baking powder",
    "2 eggs, lightly beaten",
    "1 cup milk",
    "Salt to taste",
    "1 (16-ounce) can creamed corn",
    "1 large onion, chopped",
    "1 (4.5-ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained",
    "½ pound grated mozzarella cheese"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350º F.  Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with spray Pam© or similar cooking oil and set it aside for later use.",
    "Brown the ground beef in a skillet and drain all juices and grease the beef releases.  In an 8-cup mixing bowl mix the cornmeal, baking powder, salt, eggs, milk, and creamed corn.  Mix to make a thin cornmeal batter.",
    "Pour half of the cornmeal batter into the prepared baking dish.  Over the cornmeal batter spread the ground beef; then over the beef layer the onion, green chiles, and the grated cheese.  Lastly, pour the remaining cornmeal batter over the top and spread it evenly to cover all the ingredients.",
    "Place the baking dish in the center rack of the preheated oven and bake for 45 minutes; or, until the cornmeal is baked golden around the edges."
  ],
  "remarks": "The original recipe calls for using baking soda but I’ve found baking powder is preferable as it leaves no bitter taste; so I’ve substituted accordingly. I also have some doubt about the cornmeal batter as detailed in the recipe.  After I try this recipe once I may choose to make it the second time using and modifying a more traditional corn bread batter recipe. Yield:  Serves 12.
