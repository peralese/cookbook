    "½ teaspoon ground cumin",
    "½ teaspoon granulated garlic",
    "1½ teaspoon salt",
    "½ teaspoon chili powder",
    "½ teaspoon cornstarch",
    "¼ teaspoon black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients."

  "remarks": "This dry rub keeps indefinitely in the refrigerator. Apply the rub when it’s at room temperature.  For a brisket, rub two-thirds of the mixture on the “fat” side and the other third on the “bottom” before grilling.  For chicken or ribs, simply rub on while grilling. Yield:  Make enough for a 4 to 5 pound brisket.
