    "Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350° F.",
    "Spread four cups of Fritos in a 9- by 13-inch baking dish, reserving two cups for later use.  Spread half of the cheese over the Fritos then on top of the cheese spoon the chili.  Sprinkle the onions and the pickled jalapeños on top of the chili; then, spread the remaining Fritos on top.  Lastly, spread the remaining grated cheese on top of the last layer of Fritos.",
