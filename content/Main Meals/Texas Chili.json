  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 pounds “chili-ground” beef",
    "1 large onion, chopped",
    "2 cloves garlic, minced",
    "1 teaspoon ground oregano",
    "1 teaspoon cumin",
    "3 tablespoons chili powder",
    "2 16-ounce cans of stewed tomatoes, crushed and chopped",
    "2 cups hot water",
    "2 green bell peppers, chopped",
    "3 large red sweet peppers, chopped",
    "3 large yellow sweet peppers, chopped",
    "2 or 3 jalapeños, to taste",
    "Salt, to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place the chili meat, onion, and garlic in a large heavy boiler or skillet.  Sear over medium-high heat, until all the meat is lightly colored.  Add the oregano, cumin, chili powder, tomatoes, and hot water, and stirring, bring the mixture to a boil.  Lower the heat to low and simmer the chili for about an hour.  As the food cooks and the fat rises, skim it off.",
    "After about an hour add the salt and the jalapeños.  Taste the mixture to insure its saltiness and spiciness are to your taste; adjust if not.  Cook the chili for 15 more minutes before removing from the heating and serving."
  ],
  "remarks": "Of course, chili is a  standard.  You can season it as hot as you want, and on a cold winter night, you make a big pot of chili and eat it for a couple of days with cornbread or crackers.  Again, you don’t have to use fancy cuts of meat, and you grind the beef to what we call chili grind, which is a little coarser than regular hamburger meat. Everybody thinks their chili is the best, and the thing is, in your mind, chili is what your mother served you, even if it came out of a can. Yield:  Makes 9 large bowls.
