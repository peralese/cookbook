  "ingredients": [
    "For the Sauce –",

    "12 shallots, peeled and chopped",
    "2 cloves garlic, peeled and quartered",
    "1 piece fresh turmeric root, ⅝-inch long",
    "Main Ingredients –",

  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Grind the chilies, shallots, garlic and turmeric together in a mortar.  Heat the oil in a pan and fry the spice paste until the flavors develop.  In the paste gently fry the beef strips until just done then stir in the lemongrass and ginger.  Mix well then deglaze the pan with the tamarind juice, season with salt and bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the meat is tender and the sauce is thickened.",
    "Remarks:  The recipe is interpreted from the original in as it applies to ginger.  The original calls for “galangal root” instead of ginger, but the book calls galangal root, “ginger like”.  Look for it or substitute ginger as I did.  However, if you use galangal root it should simply be “lightly crushed” not grated.  I would also strongly recommend you cut down the number of chilies to a quantity you can handle.",
    "Yield:  Serves 4 to 6.",
