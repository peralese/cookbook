  "title": "Classic Meatloaf",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "Meatloaf –",
    "1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce",
    "1½ pounds lean ground beef",
    "½ pound ground pork",
    "1½ cup soft bread crumbs",
    "1 egg",
    "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
    "2 ribs celery, finely chopped",
    "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce",
    "1 teaspoon thyme leaves, crushed",
    "½ teaspoon garlic salt",
    "¼ teaspoon black pepper",
    "Topping-",
    "1 tablespoon packed brown sugar",
    "1 teaspoon dry mustard",
    "¼ cup tomato sauce"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350° F.",
    "In ¼ cup of tomato sauce, mix the brown sugar and dried mustard and set aside.",
    "In a mixing bowl combine all the meatloaf ingredients.  Mix thoroughly and transfer the mixture to an 8-by-4½ inch meatloaf pan.  Bake for 45 minutes in the center rack of the preheated oven.  Pull from the oven and pour the topping mixture over the meatloaf and spread evenly.  Return the meatloaf to the oven and bake for an additional 15 minutes; or, to a “medium” level of “doneness” (160° F. using a meat thermometer).",
    "Remove from the oven and allow the meatloaf to sit for 10 minutes before cutting into slices and serving."
  ],
  "remarks": "First, I doubled the brown sugar and dry mustard quantities for the “topping”. Second, try to have the two, the celery and onion, chopped to about the same size. Thirdly, if you want a more seasoned meatloaf then use seasoned bread crumbs. (Italian seasoned bread crumbs go well.) Yield:  Serves 6.
