  "title": "Roasted Chicken with Smoky Apricot Sauce",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "10 (5-ounce) skinless chicken breast halves (with bone)",
    "1½ cups apricot preserve",
    "2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce",
    "1 teaspoon liquid smoke",
    "Salt, to taste",
    "Black pepper, to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 400º F.",
    "Using Pam©, or a similar cooking oil spray, spray a large roasting pan in preparation.",
    "In a small mixing bowl combine the apricot preserve, the soy sauce, and the liquid smoke.  Mix the ingredients until the three ingredients are well combined.",
    "Remove excess fat from the chicken breasts then rinse and pat dry the individual pieces using paper towels.  Set the pieces aside until all are done; then pat them dry one last time as you arrange them in the roasting pan.  Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper then pour the apricot mixture over the chicken breasts and place the roasting pan in the middle rack of the oven.  Roast the chicken breasts for 35 minutes; or, until the chicken is cooked through."
  ],
  "remarks": "Baste the chicken breasts once or twice as they roast. Serve the chicken hot from the oven using the apricot and drippings as a gravy (which you may wish to thicken with corn starch mixed in cold water). Refrigerate the remaining chicken breasts until next you wish to use for a meal (may refrigerate for up to one weeks); or, freeze (will freeze up to 3 months). Yield:  Makes 10 individual servings.
