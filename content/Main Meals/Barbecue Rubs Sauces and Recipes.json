  "remarks": "The Slaughterhouse and pork rubs, above, are designed for large cuts of meat.  Both rubs have a high percentage of sugar.  If one uses lower cooking temperatures then the amount of sugar may be increased and achieve a sweeter aftertaste.  Finally, white sugar and lemon pepper taste better with brisket while brown sugar and cumin go better with pork. Slaughterhouse Rib Rub",
