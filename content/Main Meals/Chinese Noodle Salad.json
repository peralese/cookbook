  "instructions": [
    "Make marinade by combining first nine ingredients in a bowl and stirring until the sugar is dissolved.  Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add noodles.  Stir to prevent sticking.  Cook briefly until al-dente, then immediately pour noodles into a colander and rinse with cold water.  Shake the colander and rinse with cold water.  Shake the colander vigorously to get rid of as much water as possible and put noodles in a bowl.",
    "Stir the marinade again, then pour half of it over the noodles and toss with hands to distribute evenly.   If the noodles aren't to be used for a while, cover with plastic and refrigerate them.  The flavors and the heat in the red pepper oil will develop as the noodles sit.",
