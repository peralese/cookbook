    "2 pounds lean chuck roast, cut into ½-inch cubes",
    "1½ tablespoons cooking oil",
    "4 medium potatoes, peeled and diced",
    "½ medium onion, chopped",

  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a Dutch oven, over moderately high heat, brown the meat in the oil.  Once the meat has lost it pink color add the potatoes and onions and continue browning.  Once the meat begin to caramelize (showing dark brown bits) remove the Dutch oven from the heat and remove all the excess oil and fat that has been rendered.  Return the Dutch oven to the heat and add the chiles pieces, garlic salt, salt, and water.  Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly.  Once the mixture begins boiling, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for at least more 30 minutes.",
    "Check to insure that the potatoes have cooked through and that the saltiness is to your taste.  After adjusting the taste remove the stew from the heat and ladle into bowls and serve over your favorite noodles, rice, or over homemade bread.",
    "Remarks:  This is another chuck-wagon variation with a New Mexican influence.",
    "Yield:  Serves 6.",
