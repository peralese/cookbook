    "Instructions:  In a food processor, puree onion, carrots, celery and garlic into a course paste.   In a large pan over medium heat, coat pan with oil.   Add the pureed vegetables and season generously with salt.   Bring the pan to medium high heat and cook until all of the water has evaporated, and they become nice and brown, stirring frequently about 15 to 20 minutes.",

    "Add water to the pan until the water is about 1 inch above the meat.  Toss in the bay leaves and the bundle of thyme and stir to combine everything.   Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.  As water evaporates gradually add more (2 to 3 cups at a time).  Don’t be shy about adding more water during cooking process as it can be cooked out.  Stir and taste frequently.  Season as needed.   Simmer for 3 ½ to 4 hours.",
