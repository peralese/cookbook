    "Cut the pork into 1-inch cubes and brown them in the oil using a large soup pan or Dutch oven over medium heat.  As the cube of pork are seared brown remove from the heat and place them in plate.  When done in the same pan add the onion and cook until it’s translucent then add the garlic and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes.  If there is any oil remaining once the onion and garlic have been cooked drain it and then add the water, tomatoes, chilies, potatoes and all the seasonings and stir the mixture well and bring to a boil.  When the mixture reaches a boil reduce the heat, cover and simmer for an hour, or until the vegetables are tender.",
    "Remarks:  I added carrots to the recipe and it turned out excellent.  I imagine that one can add frozen corn, etc. and it would still make an excellent stew.",
