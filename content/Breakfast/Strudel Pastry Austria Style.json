Slowly add ice water until dough comes together. Remove and form into a ball, then flatten it into a 8 by 10-inch rectangle and place in refrigerator. This is called the pasta mixture. In a food processor, place the remaining butter and 1 cup flour, and mix until blended and scrape out on to board. Working quickly, form this mixture in a 4-inch square and place in refrigerator. This is called the burro mixture. After 1/2 hour, when the 2 mixtures are similar in texture, place pasta mixture on a well-floured clean marble surface. Place burro mixture in center and fold the pasta mixture over it, like wrapping a gift. Flatten with a rolling pin and roll out to an 8 by 16-inch rectangle, flouring regularly. If butter comes to surface, flour the spot heavily and continue working. Fold bottom third up and top third down to form a small package and turn 90-degrees clockwise. Pat dough with rolling pin to adhere and roll out to large 8 by 16-inch rectangle again. Repeat folding process and refrigerate 30 minutes, covered in a moist cloth. Remove and repeat the rolling-and-folding process 3 times. Allow 30 minutes refrigeration between each maneuver. The dough is now ready and will keep in the refrigerator 10 days, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap. Prep Time: 10 minutes\nCook Time: 3 hours\nDifficulty: Medium",
