  "title": "Chicken Breasts in Green Sauce (Pollo Suizo Villa Santa Monica)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 whole boneless, skinless, chicken breast (about 2½ pounds total)",
    "½ stick (¼ cup) unsalted butter",
    "A 13-ounce can of tomatillos, drained",
    "1 large garlic clove",
    "1 small onion, chopped",
    "1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves, minced (more if you prefer)",
    "2 canned pickled jalapeños, seeded and chopped (you decide how spicy)",
    "1 teaspoon sugar",
    "½ cup sour cream",
    "1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese, grated, or to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Halve the chicken breasts, remove fatty parts, rinse then pat them dry with paper towels.  Season them with salt and pepper.",
    "In a large skillet brown the chicken breasts in the butter over moderately high heat for 2 to 3 minutes on each side.  Don’t crowd the breasts in the frying pan.  When done transfer them to a baking dish that is large enough to hold them all in a single layer.",
    "In a blender purée the tomatillos with the garlic, the onion, the cilantro, the jalapeños, the sugar, and salt.  Taste the results to determine if the flavors are balanced and to your tastes, if not, adjust before using.",
    "Pour the salsa over the chicken breasts then dot them with the sour cream.  Lastly sprinkle the grated cheese over the chicken breasts and bake the dish in a preheated 350° F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbling and the chicken breasts are cooked through.",
    "Remarks:  If you decide to use fresh tomatillos I would recommend that you roast them rather than simply cooking them in water.  Roasting them on a comal, or a cast iron skillet, will give them a much better flavor than simply boiling them in water.  Additionally, tomatillos frequently have a very sharp taste, so you should use the sugar to balance the tomatillo taste.  You want to achieve a balance in which the cilantro, onion, garlic, and tomatillo all contribute to the sauce but none dominate (unless, have the one ingredient that you prefer to be the dominant taste.)",
