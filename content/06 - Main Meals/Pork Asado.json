  "requires": "This recipe requires “Red Chile Paste” and “Red Chile Sauce”, the recipes for which are both in the “Miscellaneous” < “Odds and Ends” folder.",
  "ingredients": [
    "½ cup all-purpose flour",
    "Kosher salt to taste",
    "4 pounds pork butt, cut into ½-inch cubes",
    "2 tablespoons oil",
    "1 cup diced bacon",
    "½ cup diced red onion",
    "6 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped",
    "2 cups red chile sauce",

  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Combine the flour and the salt in a bowl.  Toss the pork in the flour and shake off the excess.  In a large Dutch oven or deep skillet, heat the oil over medium heat.  When the oil is hot and barely smoking add the bacon, onion, and garlic and sauté until the onion is translucent but not browned, 4 to 5 minutes.  Raise the heat to medium-high; add the pork cubes, and cook, turning as necessary, until it’s well browned on all sides.  Add the two cups of chile sauce and the chicken stock, reduce the heat and simmer until the pork is tender, 25 to 30 minutes."
