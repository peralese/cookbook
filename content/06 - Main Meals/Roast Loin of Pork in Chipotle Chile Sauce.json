  "title": "Roast Loin of Pork in Chipotle  Sauce (Puerco Enchipolado)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 five- to six-pound pork loin; or, a boneless boned-and-tied double loin",
    "3 large garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced",
    "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "Salsa “enchipolada”"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350º F.",
    "Using a sharp paring knife, cut small slits into the pork just large enough to insert the slivers of garlic, and insert them evenly all through the pork loin.  Next rub the black pepper and salt into the meat.  (The source of this recipe covers the roast with a coating of fresh lard before rubbing in the black pepper and salt.)",
    "Place the roast in a roasting pan and bake it in the preheated oven for 2 to 2½ hours.  It will depend on the cut and size of the roast but its internal temperature should be 160º F. when it’s done.",
    "In the last 15 minutes of the roast in the oven pour the “enchipolada” sauce into a pot and heat it, and keep it hot.",
    "Allow the roast to sit, covered with a piece of aluminum foil, for 15 minutes after you remove it from the oven.  Slice the roast into slices, arrange them on a serving platter, and pour some of the heated “enchipolada” sauce over the sliced roast and bring it to the table.",
    "Make sure that you’ve reserved enough of the “enchipolada” sauce to fill a sauce boat to set it on the table for those who may wish more."
  ],
  "remarks": "You’ll need plenty of French bread or tortillas to soak up the sauce.  Serve with Spanish rice.",
  "yield": "Serves 10.",
