  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 slice white bread, crusts removed and discarded",
    "6 ounces ground pork",
    "4 ounces fresh pork sausage (preferably without fennel), casings removed, meat mashed",
    "with a fork",
    "1 teaspoon sweet (not smoked) paprika",
    "½ teaspoon coarse salt (kosher or sea)",
    "½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "½ teaspoon dried oregano",
    "1 small pinch of ground cinnamon",
    "1 large garlic clove, crushed with a garlic press",
    "2 heaping tablespoons pine nuts",
    "1 large egg",
    "Olive oil, for shaping the meatballs"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 425º F.",
    "Place the bread in a small bowl and add enough water to cover the slice of bread and allow it to soak for 2 or 3 minutes.  Drain the water and squeeze out the excess liquid.  Crumble the soaked bread.",
    "Place the crumbled bread and the pork, sausage, paprika, salt, pepper, oregano, cinnamon, garlic, pine nuts, and the egg in a large bowl.  Gently knead the meatball with your hands just until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined; but its important not to over knead the mixture.",
    "Lightly oil your hands, then break off a piece of the meatball mixture and shape it into a 1¼-inch ball and place it on a rimmed baking sheet.  Repeat the process using all of the meatball mixture.  Bake the meatballs, shaking the baking sheet once or twice, until they are lightly browned and firm to the touch, about 12 minutes.  (The meatballs may be prepared up to a day ahead and refrigerated, covered.)"
