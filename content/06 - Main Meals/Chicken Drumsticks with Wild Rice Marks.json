  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 medium size onion, minced",
    "1 stick (½ cup) unsalted butter",
    "1 cup wild rice, rinsed well and drained",
    "2¾ cups dry white wine",
    "1 cup pine nuts, toasted lightly",
    "¾ cup currants",
    "8 chicken drumsticks, rinsed and patted dry",
    "⅓ cup all-purpose flour",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "¼ teaspoon sweet paprika",
    "¼ teaspoon cayenne",
    "1 teaspoon cornstarch dissolved in 1 tablespoon cold water",
    "½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a saucepan cook the onion in 3 tablespoons of the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, for 8 to 10 minutes; or, until it is softened and translucent.  Raise the heat to medium high and add the wild rice and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add 2¼ cups of the wine and bring the liquid to a boil then lower the heat to low and simmer the mixture, covered, for 30 to 40 minutes; or, until the wild rice is almost tender.  Remove the wild rice mixture from the heat and if there is any remaining liquid pour it off.  Add the pine nuts and currants to the rice mixture cover it again, and set it aside.",
    "Season the chicken with salt and black pepper then coat it with flour.  Shake off any excess flour and set the chicken aside for the moment allowing the flour to dry.  In a large skillet heat 2 tablespoons of the remaining butter with the oil over high heat until it just begins to smoke.  Brown the chicken pieces well in the hot oil/butter mixture.  As the chicken pieces are browned remove the pieces to drain on paper towels.",
    "Transfer the chicken to an ovenproof serving dish, where the pieces can fit, all in a single layer.  Sprinkle the chicken pieces with the paprika and cayenne.  Discard all, except approximately two tablespoons of the hot oil/butter remaining in the skillet, and deglaze the skillet with the remaining ½ cup of wine over moderately high heat, scraping up all the brown bits.  Add 1 tablespoon of the remaining butter and the cornstarch mixture to the skillet and cook the mixture over low heat, stirring until it is smooth.  Spoon this gravy over the chicken pieces.  Next spoon the wild rice mixture evenly over the chicken.  Sprinkle the Parmesan over the chicken and wild rice; cut the 2 tablespoons of butter in to small pieces and dot the top of the chicken and wild rice.",
    "Bake the chicken and wild rice in a preheated 325º F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes; or, until the chicken is cooked through.",
    "Remarks:  When I read this recipe it struck me as worth trying but with chicken thighs or breasts.  The wild rice mixture surrounding the chicken breasts should keep them moist and tender.",
    "Yield:  Serves 4 to 6.",
