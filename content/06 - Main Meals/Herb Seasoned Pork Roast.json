    "Combine all the spices and herbs.  Trim off any excess fat from the roast and with a sharp knife cut slits on the roast ½-inch deep approximately at 1-inch intervals.  Rub the spice and herb mixture all over the roast, concentrating on getting the majority of the mixture in the cuts of the roast.  Place the roast in a roasting pan with 2-inches of water and cover.  Bake at 350º F. for 1½ to 2 hours; or, until a meat thermometer registers 160º in the center of the roast.",
    "Remarks:  Make sure you use the juices to make a heavy gravy as the pork by itself will be rather dry.",
