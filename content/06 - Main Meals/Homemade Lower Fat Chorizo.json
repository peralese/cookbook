  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "¾ pound ground pork",
    "¾ pound ground (90% or better, lean) beef",
    "5 to 7 tablespoons red chili powder; or, ground red chili (cayenne pepper)",
    "5 large garlic cloves, minced fine",
    "1 teaspoon Mexican leaf oregano",
    "¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons white vinegar",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "½ teaspoon black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Mix all the ingredients well, by hand, in a bowl.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it cure in the refrigerator for a day or so.",
    "As noted above, in the list of ingredients, you may use ground red chili (cayenne pepper) instead of chili powder if you prefer a “hot and spicy” chorizo.  However, you will need to add a tablespoon or so of cumin (or to taste) to this recipe since the ground red chili (cayenne pepper) doesn’t have the cumin that the chili powder has.  It wouldn’t hurt to taste the mixture by cooking a bite size piece of the mixture in the microwave to check the “spiciness” and its overall seasoning before curing the chorizo."
