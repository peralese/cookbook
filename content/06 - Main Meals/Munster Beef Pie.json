  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup chopped onion",
    "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
    "2 garlic cloves, minced",
    "1 pound ground chuck",
    "1 cup thawed frozen corn",
    "1 green bell pepper, chopped",

  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large skillet cook the onion in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until it is softened and translucent, add the garlic, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the chuck and cook the mixture, stirring and breaking up the lumps, until the chuck is no longer pink.  At this point add the corn, the bell pepper, the raisins, the tomato sauce, the ketchup, the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste and simmer the mixture, stirring, for 10 minutes, or until it is thickened.  Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mixture cool.",
    "Line the bottom and sides of a deep-dish 9-inch glass pie plate with some of the Műnster, top the Műnster with the meat mixture, smoothing the top, and cover the mixture with the remaining Műnster.  Set the plate in a baking pan, add enough hot water to the pan to reach halfway up the side of the plate, and bake the pie in the middle of a preheated 350° F. oven for 35 minutes.  Let the pie cool on a rack for 20 minutes before serving."
