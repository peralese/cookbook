  "title": "Fried Chicken Tenders",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into 1-inch-wide strips",
    "1 teaspoon coarse-grained salt",
    "½ teaspoon cracked black pepper",
    "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard",
    "2 tablespoons minced garlic",
    "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest",
    "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
    "1 cup fresh breadcrumbs",
    "1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 lemon, cut into wedges"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper.  In a shallow baking dish, whisk together the Dijon mustard, garlic, lemon zest, and lemon juice.  Add the chicken, turning the pieces several times to coat it evenly.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes but preferably overnight.",
    "Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and dredge them in the breadcrumbs, coating evenly.",
    "Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  When it’s hot, add 1 tablespoon of oil.  (Only add more oil if absolutely necessary.)  Add the chicken and cook until it’s crispy and golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Serve the chicken with lemon wedges."
  ],
  "remarks": "When a recipe calls for breadcrumbs, I [the author, Kathleen Daelemans] always make extra and stores the extra in the freezer in freezer-safe bags.  Of course I [the author] always buy and freeze extras chicken breasts, wrapping each one separately so I [the author] don’t pull out too many or too few. Erick has made this recipe and says it’s very good but that he used Emril’s Essence to spice up the breadcrumbs and thought the chicken tenders came out better. Yield:  Serves 4.
