    "For the Spaetzle -",
    "In a bowl whisk together eggs, milk, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Gradually stir in enough flour to make a thick batter. You will probably not need all 3 cups.",
    "Using a metal colander set over a pot of boiling, salted water, press spaetzle batter through holes directly into water.",
    "When spaetzle are cooked through, they will float to surface, about 5 minutes. Scoop up with a slotted spoon and drain well as they cook or drain all at once.",
    "Making the meal –",
    "Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté the ham steak until heated through and browned, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer ham steak to a platter and keep it warm. Add the heavy cream to hot skillet and reduce it until it’s thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes. Add the mustard and simmer for 1 minute. Add the cooked spaetzle and mix and stir the mixture with the sauce. Pour the mustard cream spaetzle sauce on top of the ham steak and serve.",
    "Yield:  Serves 4.",
