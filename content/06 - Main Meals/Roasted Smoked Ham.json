  "title": "Roasted Smoked Ham (Reindl-Grill)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "4½ pound smoke ham such as a Virginia Smithfield Ham",
    "Düsseldorf-style mustard",
    "½ to 1 cup stale bread crumbs (You will use as much as will stick to the ham.)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Butter and set aside a baking pan with a lid, large enough to hold the ham.",
    "In a large kettle or other suitable container, that will contain the ham, bring enough water in which to place and boil the whole ham to a rolling boil.  Allow the water to return to a boil and boil the ham for 15 minutes.",
    "Transfer the ham to a cutting board and when it’s cool enough to handle pat it dry with paper towels.",
    "Trim and discard the rind, leaving the fat intact and on the ham.  Spread the ham with 1 to 1½ tablespoons of Düsseldorf-style mustard; or, to taste.  Then to the mustard coated ham spread ⅓ to ½ cup of stale bread crumbs; or, as much as will adhere to the ham.  Place the ham into a buttered baking pan with a lid.",
    "Preheat the oven to 375° F.",
    "Roast the ham for 25 minutes, covered on the center rack.  After 25 minutes remove the lid and roast the ham for 25 to 35 minutes more; or, until a meat thermometer, inserted into the center of the thickest part of the ham, registers 185° F.",
    "Transfer the ham to a heated platter and serve."
  ],
  "remarks": "In  the ham would be served with sauerkraut and stewed apples.",
  "yield": "Serves 6 to 8 persons.",
