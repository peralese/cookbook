    "In a large re-sealable plastic bag or shallow glass container combine the ingredients and mix well.  Add the T-bone steaks and turn to coat them well.  If in a shallow glass container cover with plastic and refrigerate; if in a plastic bag seal and refrigerate.  Allow the T-bone steaks to marinade in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.

Grill the steaks, uncovered, over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes on each side; or, until the meat reaches the level of “doneness” you prefer.  If you use a meat thermometer use the following rule:  rare - 140º F., medium - 160º F., and well done - 170º F.",
