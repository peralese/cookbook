  "title": "Breaded Veal Cutlets (Wiener Schnitzel)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound veal scallops, pounded very thin (as for scaloppini)",
    "½ teaspoon salt",
    "⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "⅓ cup unsifted all-purpose flour",
    "2 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten",
    "1 cup fine white bread crumbs",
    "3 tablespoons clarified butter",
    "3 tablespoons peanut or other vegetable oil",
    "1 large lemon, thinly sliced"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 275º F.",
    "Cut in halve any of the scallops that are too large and sprinkle both sides of each piece with the salt and pepper.  Let them stand at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "Place the flour on a piece of wax paper, the eggs in a pie plate, and the crumbs in a second pie plate.  Line the three things up on the counter near the stove so that you don’t waste time breading and browning the veal scallops.",
    "Heat the clarified butter and oil together in a heavy 12-inch skillet over moderately high heat for about 2 minutes, or until a cube of bread sizzles when place in the skillet.  Brown the scallops quickly half (what fits without crowding in the skillet) – about 3 minutes to a side.  When browned them to a shallow pan lined with paper toweling and set them, uncovered, in the warm oven.  Brown the remaining scallops in the same way.",
    "Serve at once with the lemon slices."
