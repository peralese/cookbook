  "instructions": [
    "The night before you plan to barbecue, stir together all the dry ingredients for Wild Willy’s Number “One derful” Rub in a small bowl.  Apply the mixed rub evenly to the brisket, massaging it into every little “nook and cranny” reserving one tablespoon to use in making the basic beer mop.  Place the brisket in a plastic bag and refrigerate overnight.",
    "On the day you intend to barbecue remove the brisket from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for at least 45 minutes; longer is better.",
    "In a saucepan, mix the “beer mop” ingredients, with a half-cup water, and warm the mixture over low heat.",
    "It’s best if you use a smoker but if you don’t have a smoker prepare the barbecue grill to be used as a smoker.  You’ll need to keep the heat source restricted to one end of the grill and not use excessive charcoal.  (You need to keep the heat level on the side of the grill where the meat will be on the grill controlled to between 200° to 220° F. for a period of 1 to 1½ hours per pound of brisket.)  Since it’s difficult to do this with a grill be prepared to add charcoal briquettes and wet hickory chips periodically to keep the “smoker” going. (With a barbecue grill the whole process is imprecise and you will need to use care and judgment for the entire cooking period.  If you have a smoker, prepare it; bringing the temperature to between 200° to 220° F.",
    "In the smoker, or the grill, keep the brisket in the “coolest” part of the smoker or grill, with the fat side up so that the juices will help baste the meat as they run off.  Cook the brisket until well done and tender, 1 to 1½ hours per pound.  Every hour or so, baste the blackening brisket with the beer mop and check the heat level (add more charcoal briquettes and wet hickory chips if necessary).",
    "When the brisket is cooked, remove it from the smoker, or barbecue grill, and let it sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.",
    "Cut away the fatty top section away from the leaner bottom portion (an easily identifiable layer of fat separates the two sections.)  Trim excess fat from both pieces and slice them thinly against the grain.  (Watch what you’re doing because the grain changes direction.)",
    "If you wish, serve with a tomato-based barbecue sauce on the side."
