  "title": "Favorite Beef Meat Loaf",
  "category": "06 - Main Meals",
  "requires": "This recipe requires a “Catsup Topping”.  The recipe is in the “Miscellaneous” > “Odds and Ends” folder.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup bread crumbs",
    "1 cup milk",
    "1½ pounds lean ground beef",
    "¼ cup finely chopped celery",
    "¼ cup finely chopped carrots",
    "½ cup chopped onion",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "1 teaspoon ground sage",
    "2 eggs, beaten",
    "¼ teaspoon black pepper"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Place the bread crumbs in a large mixing bowl and add the milk; let the bread crumbs soak up the milk then add the ground beef, eggs, onion, celery, carrots, sage, pepper, and ground sage and mix well.  Spray the inside of a loaf pan (8½ by 4½ by 2½-inches) with Pam®, pour the meatloaf mixture in and shape the meatloaf.",
    "Bake the meatloaf at 350° F. for 45 minutes.  While the meatloaf is baking prepare the Catsup Topping and have it ready.",
    "After 45 minutes remove the meatloaf from the oven and pour the Catsup Topping on top, spread it evenly, and return the meatloaf to the oven for an additional 15 minutes."
  ],
  "remarks": "The original recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of MSG (monosodium glutamate) but in my old age I’ve been making this recipe without it and it’s just as good.  Additionally, the salt quantity is perfect for 1½ pounds of ground beef; it would be too much for less ground beef and too little for a greater quantity of ground beef.  So, make the recipe once then adjust the salt to your taste next time.",
  "yield": "Serves 4 to 6.  (In other words, “mum-mum good” left overs.)",
