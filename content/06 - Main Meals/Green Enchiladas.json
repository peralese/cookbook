    "First you need to make the tomatillo salsa used as part of the recipes.   Husk, wash and cut the tomatillos into quarters.  Place the tomatillos, jalapenos and water in a blender or a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Puree just until chunky. Add the remaining ingredients (Onion, Cilantro and salt) and puree about 2 minutes more, or until no large chunks remain.",
    "Put salsa in medium soup pan and simmer for about 20 minutes.  Allow to cool.",
    "Pre-Heat oven to 350.",
    "I usually make two layers in the casserole pan, this is about 20-30 tortillas",
    "Now it is pretty much assembly line.  I set up on a counter next to microwave, with the pan of green tomatillo salsa, casserole dish, and the cheese/ meat nearby.",
    "Take your tortillas a few at a time, wrap in slightly damp paper towel and put in microwave for 20 seconds.",
    "Submerge the tortillas (one at a time) in the salsa.",
    "Remove and place in casserole dish.",
    "Add some chicken/turkey",
    "Add some cheese",
    "Roll up (like a cigar) and place in casserole dish.",
    "Repeat",
    "Once you have filled your casserole dish Pour remaining salsa on top of the enchiladas.  Add cheese on top of the casserole as well.",
    "Bake in oven for 20-25 minutes.",
    "Garnish – Mexican Crema little drizzled over the enchiladas"
