  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 three-quarter pound brook trout, cleaned, with the heads and tails intact",
    "8 slices of lean bacon",
    "½ cup yellow cornmeal",
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
    "lemon wedges for garnish"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Pat the trout dry and season them with salt inside and out, with salt and pepper.  Secure the end of 1 slice of the bacon in the gills of a trout and start to wrap the bacon in a spiral fashion around the trout.  Secure a second bacon slice to the end of the first slice with a wooden toothpick and continue to spiral the bacon around the trout, ending at the tail.  Secure the end of the second bacon slice to the tail with another toothpick and roll the trout in the cornmeal, sprinkled on a sheet of wax paper, coating it completely and shaking off the excess gently.  Secure and wrap the bacon slices around the remaining trout and roll them in the cornmeal in the same manner as the first.",
    "Heat a large heavy skillet, preferable oval, over moderately high heat until it is hot then add 1 tablespoon each of butter and oil, and heat the mixture until it’s hot but not smoking.  Add 2 of the trout and panfry them for 4 minutes on each side, or until they are firm to the touch and the bacon is golden.  Transfer the trout carefully with a slotted spatula to a platter and keep them warm, covered loosely.  Panfry the remaining trout in the remaining butter and oil in the same manner and transfer them carefully to the platter.",
    "Remove the wooden toothpicks carefully and garnish the platter with the lemon wedges.",
    "Yield:  Serves 4.",
    "Remarks:  This recipe can easily be modified for two.",
