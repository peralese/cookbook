  "title": "Fried Chicken Tacos (Tacos Dorados de Pollo)",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "½ teaspoon salt",
    "2 cups shredded, cooked chicken",
    "12 soft corn tortillas",
    "¾ cup vegetable oil",
    "2 cups thinly shredded lettuce",
    "¼ pound queso fresco, crumbled"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "To the shredded chicken add the salt and mix it well",
    "Place a corn tortilla on a dry comal or frying pan to heat it and make it pliable.  Heat it on both sides.  Remove it to a plate and continue heating and warming all the tortillas.",
    "Down the middle of each tortilla spread some of the shredded chicken and roll it up.  Secure the rolled up tortilla with a toothpick.  After all of the tortillas have been completed, heat the oil in a large, heavy frying pan, until it is smoking.  Using a pair of tongs grab and place the rolled up tacos and place them in the hot oil.  Fry the tacos until they are crispy, about 6 minutes.",
    "Drain the tacos well and serve them with the shredded lettuce, crumbled queso fresco and hot sauce on the side, for individuals to add to their own tacos as they choose.",
    "Remarks:  One way to get the tacos to release as much of the absorbed oil as possible is to place them in a warm oven over absorbent towels.  It’s also a good way to keep them warm while you finish frying all of them; and finalize other preparations for the meal.  However, remember, you should serve the tacos as soon as possible after you fry them otherwise they will loose their crispiness.",
    "Yield:  Makes 12 tacos.  (How many that feeds depends!)",
