    "First, place the ground beef in a 10-inch skillet and sauté over medium heat.  As the meat is sautéing begin breaking up the meat into small pieces.  Add in the salt, ground cumin, garlic, black pepper, onion, celery, and bell pepper and continue cooking, mixing and breaking up the ground beef.  Finish sautéing over medium heat, for 4 to 5 minutes, until the ground beef is no longer pink and is fully cooked.",

    "In an oven, toast as many hamburger buns as you need for your meal.  When the buns are toasted to your desired degree of crispness load them up with the “sloppy Joe” mixture and serve.  Use garnishes that suit your taste buds:  mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, pickles, onions, etc.  Serve with chips."
