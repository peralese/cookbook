  "ingredients": [
    "4 pounds pork spareribs; or, pork loin back ribs",
    "½ cup honey",
    "½ cup packed brown sugar",
    "3 tablespoons soy sauce",
    "½ teaspoon garlic powder",
    "½ teaspoon ground ginger",

  "instructions": [
    "Begin by cutting the pork ribs into serving-size pieces and place the pieces in a large sealable plastic bag.\tCombine all the ingredients and pour them over the ribs inside the plastic bag.  Seal the bag, turn once to spread the marinade over the ribs and refrigerate over night.  Occasionally, return to the refrigerator and turn the bag.",
    "Just prior to cooking drain the marinade and reserve it in the refrigerator.  Place the ribs on a rack in a greased shallow baking pan, cover and bake at 350° F. for 1½ hours.  Take the baking pan out of the oven and drain the grease and fat out of the pan.  Take the marinade that you’ve reserved and pour it over the ribs and place the ribs back in the oven and bake, uncovered, 45 minutes more or until the meat is fork tender.  During these last 45 minutes use a brush to baste the ribs with the marinade and pan juices."
