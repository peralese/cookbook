  "instructions": [
    "In a small bowl, stir together the chili powder, orange juice, olive oil, lime juice, garlic paste, cumin, orange zest, honey, tomato paste, oregano, and 1½ teaspoons of salt into an adobo.",
    "With a sharp knife, slash a shallow crosshatch pattern into the meaty side of the ribs.  Lay the ribs in a single layer in a large shallow baking pan.  Spread the adobo over both sides of the ribs, rubbing it in well, especially into the crosshatched scoring of the ribs.  Cover the pan and refrigerate the ribs for at least 24 hours; but up to 48 hours if you can plan ahead.",
    "On the day you are baking the ribs remove them from the refrigerator and allow them to begin warming up while you prepare the oven.  Position a rack in the middle position of the oven and preheat it to 350° F.",
    "Arrange the ribs in the baking dish, meaty-side down, in a single layer.  Place them in the center rack of the oven and bake them for 30 minutes.  Remove them from the oven and using tongs turn them over.  Return the ribs to the oven and bake them for another 35 to 45 minutes, covering them loosely with foil if the adobo begins getting over-cooked; or, until the meat is fork tender.",
    "Transfer the ribs to a cutting board, cover them with foil, and let them rest for at least 10 minutes.  With a thin sharp knife, cut the ribs apart, and serve them immediately."
