  "title": "Old Fashioned Swiss Steak",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 pounds round steak",
    "½ cup all-purpose flour",
    "½ teaspoon salt",
    "½ teaspoon black pepper, divided as explained in the instructions",
    "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
    "1 cup chopped onion",
    "½ cup chopped green pepper",
    "¼ cup soy sauce",
    "½ teaspoon garlic salt"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Pat the round steak dry with paper towels and trim off any excess fat, then cut it up into serving size pieces.",
    "Combine the flour, salt, and ¼ teaspoon of the black pepper then flour each steak with the seasoned flour.  Pound the seasoned flour into both sides of each steak with the palm of your hand.  Place a large skillet over medium heat, allow it to warm up then add the vegetable oil.  When the oil is starting to smoke place as many of the steaks, as the size of the skillet allows, and brown them on both sides.  If you have to do the browning in two or more batches set the browned steaks aside to drain on paper towels while you finish this task.",
    "Place all of the browned steaks into a greased 13- by 9- by 2-inches baking dish.  Top the steaks with chopped onion and green pepper.  Drizzle the dish with the soy sauce and sprinkle with the garlic salt and remaining black pepper.  Cover and bake at 325º F for 1½ hours; or, until the meat is tender.",
    "Yield:  Serves 6 to 8.",
