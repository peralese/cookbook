  "title": "Meatballs in Green Sauce",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "5 slices day-old bread",
    "1 pound ground beef",
    "½ pound Italian sausage, without skin",
    "4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced",
    "1 “bunch” basil leaves cut in “chiffonade” style (long thin strips)",
    "2 eggs",
    "½ cup pecorino cheese",
    "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, for frying; plus ½ cup more",
    "1 “bunch” Italian parsley, chopped to yield ¼ cup",
    "1 “bunch” mint, leaves only",
    "2 tablespoons white vinegar"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Soak the bread in water for 5 minutes, remove from the water and press out the liquid by hand.  Place the soaked bread in a large bowl, add the beef and the sausage and mix by hand to combine.  Add the garlic, basil, eggs, and pecorino and mix well to combine.  Make golf ball-size meatballs out of the meat mixture and set aside.",
    "In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat 1 cup of oil until it’s smoking.  Cook the meatballs in the oil until golden brown and cooked through, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan.  Remove the cooked meatballs to a plate lined with paper towels and keep them warm.",
    "In the remaining ½ cup of olive oil purée the parsley, mint and white vinegar.  Pour half the sauce over the warm meatballs and serve the other half “on the side”.  (The actual recipe calls for adding 6 anchovies, filleted and rinsed, and 3 tablespoons of caper to the green sauce.  However, I’m not an anchovy or caper fan, so I’d leave them out.)",
    "Yield:  Serves 6.",
