  "title": "Beef Stroganoff",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 pounds filet mignon, cut into thin strips; or, bite size pieces",
    "Butter",
    "1½ pounds sliced fresh mushrooms",
    "Salt and Pepper",
    "½ cup sherry",
    "2 cups sour cream",
    "Crispy Onions"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large skillet over medium-high heat sauté the beef strips in the butter until they become brown but remain rare and juicy.  (Use caution, it should take from 3 to 4 minutes.  If you err and over cook the meat will turn out tough.  However if you err and undercook, everything will still turn out ok because you are using filet mignon (little or no fat in the cut of meat)).  When the meat is done remove it from the skillet to a plate and set it aside.",
    "To the juices remaining in the skillet add more butter and briefly sauté the mushrooms.  (Remember the mushrooms will release a large amount of water.)  When the mushrooms become uniformly soft, add salt and pepper, to taste.  Stir the mixture and taste; before proceeding, make sure the saltiness is to your preference.  Once satisfied, add the sherry and continue cooking the mushrooms until the mixture begins bubbling.",
    "Lower the heat to “very” low, return the sautéed meat to the skillet, and stir in the sour cream. Allow everything to come up to “serving temperature”, stirring and blending the ingredients as the beef reheats.  However, do not all the mixture to reach a boil.  When the mixture reaches “serving temperature” turn off the heat and serve immediately.  Garnish with crispy onions.",
