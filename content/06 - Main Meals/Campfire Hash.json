  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 tablespoons cooking oil",
    "1 large onion, chopped",
    "2 garlic cloves, minced",
    "4 large potatoes, peeled and cubed (about 2 pounds total)",
    "1 pound fully cooked smoked kielbasa sausage, cubed",
    "1 can (4 ounces) chopped green chilies",
    "1 can (15 to 16 ounces) whole kernel corn, drained"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat.  When the oil is barely smoking add in the chopped onion and minced garlic and sauté until the onion is translucent and wilted.  Watch that the garlic doesn’t brown excessively while sautéing the onion; however, if you are concerned add the garlic only after the onion begins showing some translucence.  After the onion is sautéed add the cubed potatoes; stir to mix the ingredients then cover and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  After about 20 minutes add the kielbasa sausage and again stir to mix the ingredients and continue cooking until the potatoes are well browned and cooked through.",
    "Once the potatoes are browned and cooked through add in the cans of green chilies and whole kernel corn.  Stir the hash to mix all the ingredients well and continue cooking on medium heat only until the corn is heated through.",
    "Serve hot."
