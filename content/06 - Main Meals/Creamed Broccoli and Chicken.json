    "Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the broccoli, onion, and garlic and sauté the mixture until the broccoli is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and blend in the flour and salt.  Stir in the milk and return the skillet to the heat and bring to a boil, again over medium-high heat.  Once the milk begins to boil continue cooking, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.  Reduce the heat to low and add the sour cream and chicken.  Keep the mixture on the low heat until the chicken is heated through and the sour cream is well blended, but do not let the mixture come to a boil again.",
