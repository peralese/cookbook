  "instructions": [
    "First make the lard pastry dough, wrap it in wax paper and place it in the refrigerator.",
    "Second, cook the filling for the empanadas.  In a skillet cook the chopped onion and garlic in the butter over moderate heat until the onion is translucent and softened.  Add the ground chuck and cook until the meat is browned and no longer shows any pink.  Add the tomato, raisins, chili powder, flour, sugar, salt and pepper and cook the mixture for 5 minutes.  Let the mixture cool.",
    "Roll out the pastry dough ⅛ inch thick on a floured surface and with a 5-inch round cutter, cut out rounds of the dough.  Divide the filling among the rounds and, with water, moisten the edges of each round.  Fold the rounds in half, shape them into crescents, and crimp the edges with a fork.",
    "Arrange the crescents on a lightly greased baking sheet, brush them with the egg wash and bake them in a preheated moderately hot oven (375° F.), brushing them frequently with the egg wash, for 30 minutes, or until they are golden.",
    "Transfer the empanadas to a heated serving dish and serve."
