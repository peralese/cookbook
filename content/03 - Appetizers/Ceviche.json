  "title": "Ceviche",
  "requires": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 pound fillet of sole; or similar fish (very low on oils) cut into bite-size pieces",
    "¼ cup fresh lime juice (preferably key limes)",
    "1 peeled and seeded, large fresh tomato diced (preferably vine ripened)",
    "1 coarsely chopped large red onion",
    "4 ounces of pickled jalapeños, chopped",
    "¼ cup olive oil",
    "¼ cup minced fresh cilantro leaves; stems removed",
    "Salt and pepper to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large glass, or ceramic, bowl place the “bite-size” cut-up fish and to it add the lime juice and cover with plastic wrap.  Allow the fish to marinate in the refrigerator overnight; no less than 8 to 12 hours.  Turn the marinating fish pieces occasionally as they marinate.  (One is trying to “cook” the fish in the acid of the lime juice.)  When done, drain off the lime juice but reserve it. (Don’t throw it away!)",
    "Place the drained fish pieces in bowl and to it add all of the remaining ingredients and mix well.  Add some, or all, of the reserved lime juice to the fish mixture.",
    "Refrigerate and serve chilled."
  ],
  "remarks": " If you don’t like a strong olive oil taste be sure to use the “extra virgin” grade of olive oil; if on the other hand, you enjoy the olive oil taste then you may use any grade.",
